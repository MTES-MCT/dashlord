This vulnerability arises when passwords are stored\nin plaintext or with a fast hashing algorithm. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker typically requires access to the stored passwords.</p>\n<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>\n<p>Attackers who would get access to the stored passwords could reuse them without further attacks or with little additional effort.<br> Obtaining the\nplaintext passwords, they could then gain unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially leading to various malicious activities.</p>\n<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>\n<p>Plaintext or weakly hashed password storage poses a significant security risk to software applications.</p>\n<h4>Unauthorized Access</h4>\n<p>When passwords are stored in plaintext or with weak hashing algorithms, an attacker who gains access to the password database can easily retrieve\nand use the passwords to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as unauthorized data access,\nidentity theft, or even financial fraud.</p>\n<h4>Credential Reuse</h4>\n<p>Many users tend to reuse passwords across multiple platforms. If an attacker obtains plaintext or weakly hashed passwords, they can potentially use\nthese credentials to gain unauthorized access to other accounts held by the same user. This can have far-reaching consequences, as sensitive personal\ninformation or critical systems may be compromised.</p>\n<h4>Regulatory Compliance</h4>\n<p>Many industries and jurisdictions have specific regulations and standards to protect user data and ensure its confidentiality. Storing passwords in\nplaintext or with weak hashing algorithms can lead to non-compliance with these regulations, potentially resulting in legal consequences, financial\npenalties, and damage to the reputation of the software application and its developers.</p>\n<h2>How to fix it in Argon2-cffi</h2>\n<h3>Code examples</h3>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"200\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nfrom argon2 import PasswordHasher, profiles\n\ndef hash_password(password):\n    ph = PasswordHasher.from_parameters(profiles.CHEAPEST) # Noncompliant\n    return ph.hash(password)\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"200\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nfrom argon2 import PasswordHasher\n\ndef hash_password(password):\n    ph = PasswordHasher()\n    return ph.hash(password)\n</pre>\n<h3>How does this work?</h3>\n<h4>Select the correct Argon2 parameters</h4>\n<p>In general, the default values of the Argon2 library are considered safe. If you need to change the parameters, you should note the following:</p>\n<p>First, Argon2 comes in three forms: Argon2i, Argon2d and Argon2id. Argon2i is optimized for hashing passwords and uses data-independent memory\naccess. Argon2d is faster and uses data-dependent memory access, making it suitable for applications where there is no risk of side-channel\nattacks.<br> Argon2id is a mixture of Argon2i and Argon2d and is recommended for most applications.</p>\n<p>Argon2id has three different parameters that can be configured: the basic minimum memory size (m), the minimum number of iterations (t) and the\ndegree of parallelism (p).<br> The higher the values of m, t and p result in safer hashes, but come at the cost of higher resource usage. There exist\ngeneral recommendations that balance security and speed in an optimal way.</p>\n<p>Hashes should be at least 32 bytes long and salts should be at least 16 bytes long.</p>\n<p>Next, the recommended parameters for Argon2id are:</p>\n<table>\n  <colgroup>\n    <col style=\"width: 25%;\">\n    <col style=\"width: 25%;\">\n    <col style=\"width: 25%;\">\n    <col style=\"width: 25%;\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Recommendation type</th>\n      <th>Time Cost</th>\n      <th>Memory Cost</th>\n      <th>Parallelism</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td> <p>Argon2 Creators</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>1</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>2097152 (2 GiB)</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>4</p> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> <p>Argon2 Creators</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>3</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>65536 (64 MiB)</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>4</p> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> <p>OWASP</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>1</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>47104 (46 MiB)</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>1</p> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> <p>OWASP</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>2</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>19456 (19 MiB)</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>1</p> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> <p>OWASP</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>3</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>12288 (12 MiB)</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>1</p> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> <p>OWASP</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>4</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>9216 (9 MiB)</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>1</p> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> <p>OWASP</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>5</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>7168 (7 MiB)</p> </td>\n      <td> <p>1</p> </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>To use values recommended by the Argon2 authors, you can use the following objects:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> <a href=\"https://argon2-cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#argon2.profiles.RFC_9106_HIGH_MEMORY\">argon2.profiles.RFC_9106_HIGH_MEMORY</a>\n  </li>\n  <li> <a href=\"https://argon2-cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#argon2.profiles.RFC_9106_LOW_MEMORY\">argon2.profiles.RFC_9106_LOW_MEMORY</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>To use values recommended by the OWASP you can craft objects as follows:</p>\n<pre>\nfrom argon2 import Parameters\nfrom argon2.low_level import ARGON2_VERSION, Type\n\nOWASP_1 = argon2.Parameters(\n        type=Type.ID,\n        version=ARGON2_VERSION,\n        salt_len=16,\n        hash_len=32,\n        time_cost=1,\n        memory_cost=47104, # 46 MiB\n        parallelism=1)\n\ndef hash_password(password):\n    ph = PasswordHasher.from_parameters(OWASP_1)\n    return ph.hash(password)\n</pre>\n<h3>Going the extra mile</h3>\n<h4>Selecting safe custom parameters for Argon2</h4>\n<p>To determine which one is the most appropriate for your application, you can use the argon2 CLI, for example with OWASP’s first recommendation:</p>\n<pre>\n$ pip install argon2\n$ python -m argon2 -t 1 -m 47104 -p 1 -l 32\n</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://argon2-cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#module-argon2.profiles\">Learn more here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Pepper</h4>\n<p>In a defense-in-depth security approach, <strong>peppering</strong> can also be used.

Usually, this is done by escaping meta-characters such as quotes in a domain-specific way so that they are treated as normal characters.\n\nHowever, directly using the string `replace` method to perform escaping is notoriously error-prone. Common mistakes include only replacing the first occurrence of a meta-character, or backslash-escaping various meta-characters but not the backslash itself.\n\nIn the former case, later meta-characters are left undisturbed and can be used to subvert the sanitization. In the latter case, preceding a meta-character with a backslash leads to the backslash being escaped, but the meta-character appearing un-escaped, which again makes the sanitization ineffective.\n\nEven if the escaped string is not used in a security-critical context, incomplete escaping may still have undesirable effects, such as badly rendered or confusing output.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a (well-tested) sanitization library if at all possible. These libraries are much more likely to handle corner cases correctly than a custom implementation.\n\nAn even safer alternative is to design the application so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using prepared statements for SQL queries.\n\nOtherwise, make sure to use a regular expression with the `g` flag to ensure that all occurrences are replaced, and remember to escape backslashes if applicable.\n\n\n## Example\nFor example, assume that we want to embed a user-controlled string `accountNumber` into a SQL query as part of a string literal. To avoid SQL injection, we need to ensure that the string does not contain un-escaped single-quote characters. The following function attempts to ensure this by doubling single quotes, and thereby escaping them:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(\"'\", \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nAs written, this sanitizer is ineffective: if the first argument to `replace` is a string literal (as in this case), only the *first* occurrence of that string is replaced.\n\nAs mentioned above, the function `escapeQuotes` should be replaced with a purpose-built sanitization library, such as the npm module `sqlstring`. Many other sanitization libraries are available from npm and other sources.\n\nIf this is not an option, `escapeQuotes` should be rewritten to use a regular expression with the `g` (\"global\") flag instead:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(/'/g, \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nNote that it is very important to include the global flag: `s.replace(/'/, \"''\")` *without* the global flag is equivalent to the first example above and only replaces the first quote.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP Top 10: [A1 Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection).\n* npm: [sqlstring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlstring) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-80](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.23.1"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"21d128ddcaa2626c8703147c5cc2f792812ea98e","message":{"text":"This replaces only the first occurrence of \"\\n\"."},"location":{"path":"front/src/lot-add/components/lot-form.tsx","start_line":306,"end_line":306,"start_column":15,"end_column":39},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/carbure/code-scanning/alerts/66/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":65,"created_at":"2024-10-10T07:12:48Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T07:12:50Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/carbure/code-scanning/alerts/65","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/carbure/security/code-scanning/65","assignees":[],"state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/xss-through-dom","severity":"warning","description":"DOM text reinterpreted as HTML","name":"js/xss-through-dom","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-079","external/cwe/cwe-116","security"],"full_description":"Reinterpreting text from the DOM as HTML can lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.","help":"# DOM text reinterpreted as HTML\nExtracting text from a DOM node and interpreting it as HTML can lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.\n\nA webpage with this vulnerability reads text from the DOM, and afterwards adds the text as HTML to the DOM.

The `$.find` function will only interpret `target` as a CSS selector and never as HTML, thereby preventing an XSS attack.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n\t$.find(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP [DOM Based XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS).\n* OWASP [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.23.1"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"21d128ddcaa2626c8703147c5cc2f792812ea98e","message":{"text":"DOM text is reinterpreted as HTML without escaping meta-characters."},"location":{"path":"web/templates/archive/producers/settings.html","start_line":359,"end_line":359,"start_column":32,"end_column":61},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/carbure/code-scanning/alerts/64/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null}]}]}
