Usually, this is done by escaping meta-characters such as quotes in a domain-specific way so that they are treated as normal characters.\n\nHowever, directly using the string `replace` method to perform escaping is notoriously error-prone. Common mistakes include only replacing the first occurrence of a meta-character, or backslash-escaping various meta-characters but not the backslash itself.\n\nIn the former case, later meta-characters are left undisturbed and can be used to subvert the sanitization. In the latter case, preceding a meta-character with a backslash leads to the backslash being escaped, but the meta-character appearing un-escaped, which again makes the sanitization ineffective.\n\nEven if the escaped string is not used in a security-critical context, incomplete escaping may still have undesirable effects, such as badly rendered or confusing output.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a (well-tested) sanitization library if at all possible. These libraries are much more likely to handle corner cases correctly than a custom implementation.\n\nAn even safer alternative is to design the application so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using prepared statements for SQL queries.\n\nOtherwise, make sure to use a regular expression with the `g` flag to ensure that all occurrences are replaced, and remember to escape backslashes if applicable.\n\n\n## Example\nFor example, assume that we want to embed a user-controlled string `accountNumber` into a SQL query as part of a string literal. To avoid SQL injection, we need to ensure that the string does not contain un-escaped single-quote characters. The following function attempts to ensure this by doubling single quotes, and thereby escaping them:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(\"'\", \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nAs written, this sanitizer is ineffective: if the first argument to `replace` is a string literal (as in this case), only the *first* occurrence of that string is replaced.\n\nAs mentioned above, the function `escapeQuotes` should be replaced with a purpose-built sanitization library, such as the npm module `sqlstring`. Many other sanitization libraries are available from npm and other sources.\n\nIf this is not an option, `escapeQuotes` should be rewritten to use a regular expression with the `g` (\"global\") flag instead:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(/'/g, \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nNote that it is very important to include the global flag: `s.replace(/'/, \"''\")` *without* the global flag is equivalent to the first example above and only replaces the first quote.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP Top 10: [A1 Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection).\n* npm: [sqlstring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlstring) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-80](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.0"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:upload","environment":"{}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"e607d9bcee2b106d420d12066784b487df376646","message":{"text":"This replaces only the first occurrence of \"\\\\n\"."},"location":{"path":"front/src/lot-add/components/lot-form.tsx","start_line":306,"end_line":306,"start_column":15,"end_column":39},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/carbure/code-scanning/alerts/66/instances"},{"number":65,"created_at":"2024-10-10T07:12:48Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T07:12:50Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/carbure/code-scanning/alerts/65","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/carbure/security/code-scanning/65","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/xss-through-dom","severity":"warning","description":"DOM text reinterpreted as HTML","name":"js/xss-through-dom","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-079","external/cwe/cwe-116","security"],"full_description":"Reinterpreting text from the DOM as HTML can lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.","help":"# DOM text reinterpreted as HTML\nExtracting text from a DOM node and interpreting it as HTML can lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.\n\nA webpage with this vulnerability reads text from the DOM, and afterwards adds the text as HTML to the DOM.
