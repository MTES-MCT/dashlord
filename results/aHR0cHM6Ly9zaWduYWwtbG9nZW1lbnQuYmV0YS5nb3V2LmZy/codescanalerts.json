If an attacker is able to control the safe sanitized text, then this vulnerability can be exploited to perform a cross-site scripting attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing text to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the References section below.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a webpage using a `data-target` attribute to select and manipulate a DOM element using the JQuery library. In the example, the `data-target` attribute is read into the `target` variable, and the `$` function is then supposed to use the `target` variable as a CSS selector to determine which element should be manipulated.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n    $(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\nHowever, if an attacker can control the `data-target` attribute, then the value of `target` can be used to cause the `$` function to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThe above vulnerability can be fixed by using `$.find` instead of `$`. The `$.find` function will only interpret `target` as a CSS selector and never as HTML, thereby preventing an XSS attack.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n\t$.find(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP [DOM Based XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS).\n* OWASP [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.22.0"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-22.04\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"15601a332e7cd0fe634aa20cea1365cc9ad98b84","message":{"text":"DOM text is reinterpreted as HTML without escaping meta-characters."},"location":{"path":"assets/scripts/vanilla/controllers/back_signalement_form/back_signalement_form.js","start_line":325,"end_line":333,"start_column":40,"end_column":10},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/histologe/code-scanning/alerts/40/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null}]}]}
