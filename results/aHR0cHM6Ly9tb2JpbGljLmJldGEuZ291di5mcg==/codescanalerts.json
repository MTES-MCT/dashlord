Whenever that error message occurs for an end user, the developer can use the stack trace to help identify how to fix the problem. In particular, stack traces can tell the developer more about the sequence of events that led to a failure, as opposed to merely the final state of the software when the error occurred.\n\nUnfortunately, the same information can be useful to an attacker. The sequence of class names in a stack trace can reveal the structure of the application as well as any internal components it relies on. Furthermore, the error message at the top of a stack trace can include information such as server-side file names and SQL code that the application relies on, allowing an attacker to fine-tune a subsequent injection attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nSend the user a more generic error message that reveals less information. Either suppress the stack trace entirely, or log it only on the server.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an exception is handled in two different ways. In the first version, labeled BAD, the exception is sent back to the remote user by returning it from the function. As such, the user is able to see a detailed stack trace, which may contain sensitive information. In the second version, the error message is logged only on the server, and a generic error message is displayed to the user. That way, the developers can still access and use the error log, but remote users will not see the information.\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n\nimport traceback\n\ndef do_computation():\n    raise Exception(\"Secret info\")\n\n# BAD\n@app.route('/bad')\ndef server_bad():\n    try:\n        do_computation()\n    except Exception as e:\n        return traceback.format_exc()\n\n# GOOD\n@app.route('/good')\ndef server_good():\n    try:\n        do_computation()\n    except Exception as e:\n        log(traceback.format_exc())\n        return \"An internal error has occurred!\"\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Improper Error Handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-209](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-497](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/497.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.21.2"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:python\",\"language\":\"python\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-22.04\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:python","state":"open","commit_sha":"352a0f095f452805c5c8d87e38f2319009a43953","message":{"text":"Stack trace information flows to this location and may be exposed to an external user."},"location":{"path":"app/controllers/company.py","start_line":746,"end_line":746,"start_column":42,"end_column":59},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/code-scanning/alerts/107/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":106,"created_at":"2024-10-10T07:05:40Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T07:05:42Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/code-scanning/alerts/106","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/security/code-scanning/106","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"py/weak-sensitive-data-hashing","severity":"warning","description":"Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm on sensitive data","name":"py/weak-sensitive-data-hashing","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-327","external/cwe/cwe-328","external/cwe/cwe-916","security"],"full_description":"Using broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithms can compromise security.","help":"# Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm on sensitive data\nUsing a broken or weak cryptographic hash function can leave data vulnerable, and should not be used in security related code.\n\nA strong cryptographic hash function should be resistant to:\n\n* pre-image attacks: if you know a hash value `h(x)`, you should not be able to easily find the input `x`.\n* collision attacks: if you know a hash value `h(x)`, you should not be able to easily find a different input `y` with the same hash value `h(x) = h(y)`.\nIn cases with a limited input space, such as for passwords, the hash function also needs to be computationally expensive to be resistant to brute-force attacks.

An attacker\ncan manipulate the content of the token and grant themselves permissions they should not have, leading to unauthorized data access.</p>\n<h2>How to fix it in PyJWT</h2>\n<h3>Code examples</h3>\n<p>The following code contains an example of JWT decoding without verification of the signature.</p>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nimport jwt\n\njwt.decode(token, options={\"verify_signature\":False}) # Noncompliant\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<p>By default, verification is enabled for the method <code>decode</code>.</p>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nimport jwt\n\njwt.decode(token, key, algorithms=\"HS256\")\n</pre>\n<h3>How does this work?</h3>\n<h4>Verify the signature of your tokens</h4>\n<p>Resolving a vulnerability concerning the validation of JWT token signatures is mainly about incorporating a critical step into your process:\nvalidating the signature every time a token is decoded. Just having a signed token using a secure algorithm is not enough. If you are not validating\nsignatures, they are not serving their purpose.</p>\n<p>Every time your application receives a JWT, it needs to decode the token to extract the information contained within. It is during this decoding\nprocess that the signature of the JWT should also be checked.</p>\n<p>To resolve the issue, follow these instructions:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li> Use framework-specific functions for signature verification: Most programming frameworks that support JWTs provide specific functions to not\n  only decode a token but also validate its signature simultaneously. Make sure to use these functions when handling incoming tokens. </li>\n  <li> Handle invalid signatures appropriately: If a JWT’s signature does not validate correctly, it means the token is not trustworthy, indicating\n  potential tampering. The action to take when encountering an invalid token should be denying the request carrying it and logging the event for\n  further investigation. </li>\n  <li> Incorporate signature validation in your tests: When you are writing tests for your application, include tests that check the signature\n  validation functionality. This can help you catch any instances where signature verification might be unintentionally skipped or bypassed. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>By following these practices, you can ensure the security of your application’s JWT handling process, making it resistant to attacks that rely on\ntampering with tokens. Validation of the signature needs to be an integral and non-negotiable part of your token handling process.</p>\n<h3>Going the extra mile</h3>\n<h4>Securely store your secret keys</h4>\n<p>Ensure that your secret keys are stored securely. They should not be hard-coded into your application code or checked into your version control\nsystem. Instead, consider using environment variables, secure key management systems, or vault services.</p>\n<h4>Rotate your secret keys</h4>\n<p>Even with the strongest cipher algorithms, there is a risk that your secret keys may be compromised. Therefore, it is a good practice to\nperiodically rotate your secret keys. By doing so, you limit the amount of time that an attacker can misuse a stolen key. When you rotate keys, be\nsure to allow a grace period where tokens signed with the old key are still accepted to prevent service disruptions.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<h3>Standards</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/\">Top 10 2021 Category A2 - Cryptographic Failures</a> </li>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure\">Top 10 2017 Category A3 - Sensitive Data\n  Exposure</a> </li>\n  <li> CWE - <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/347\">CWE-347 - Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature</a> </li>\n</ul>","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"SonarCloud","guid":null,"version":null},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"(default)","environment":"{}","category":"","state":"open","commit_sha":"352a0f095f452805c5c8d87e38f2319009a43953","message":{"text":"<!--SONAR_ISSUE_KEY:AYyMCM-NLDc9JXTddumE-->Don't use a JWT token without verifying its signature. <p>See more on <a href=\"https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=MTES-MCT_mobilic-api&issues=AYyMCM-NLDc9JXTddumE&open=AYyMCM-NLDc9JXTddumE\">SonarQube Cloud</a></p>"},"location":{"path":"app/helpers/france_connect.py","start_line":50,"end_line":50,"start_column":49,"end_column":76},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/code-scanning/alerts/17/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":16,"created_at":"2023-12-21T11:00:39Z","updated_at":"2023-12-21T11:00:41Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/code-scanning/alerts/16","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/security/code-scanning/16","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"python:S6786","severity":"warning","description":"GraphQL introspection should be disabled in production","name":"python:S6786","tags":["cwe","graphql"],"full_description":"GraphQL introspection should be disabled in production","help":"<p>This vulnerability exposes information about all the APIs available on a GraphQL API server.

This will ensure the secret’s security and prevent any further unexpected\ndisclosure.</p>\n<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple solutions are currently available.</p>\n<p><strong>Never hard-code secrets, not even the default values</strong></p>\n<p>It is important that you do not hard-code secrets, even default values.</p>\n<p>First, hard-coded default secrets are often short and can be easily compromised even by attackers who do not have access to the code base.</p>\n<p>Second, hard-coded default secrets can cause problems if they need to be changed or replaced.</p>\n<p>And most importantly, there is always the possibility to accidentally set default secrets for production services, which can lead to security\nvulnerabilities and make production insecure by default.</p>\n<p>To minimize these risks, it is recommended to apply the above strategies, even for the default settings.</p>\n<h3>Code examples</h3>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nuri = \"postgres://foouser:foopass@example.com/testdb\"\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nimport os\n\nuser = os.environ[\"PG_USER\"]\npassword = os.environ[\"PG_PASSWORD\"]\nuri = f\"postgres://{user}:{password}@example.com/testdb\"\n</pre>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<h3>Standards</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/\">Top 10 2021 Category A7 - Identification and\n  Authentication Failures</a> </li>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure\">Top 10 2017 Category A3 - Sensitive Data\n  Exposure</a> </li>\n  <li> CWE - <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798\">CWE-798 - Use of Hard-coded Credentials</a> </li>\n  <li> CWE - <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259\">CWE-259 - Use of Hard-coded Password</a> </li>\n  <li> STIG Viewer - <a href=\"https://stigviewer.com/stig/application_security_and_development/2023-06-08/finding/V-222642\">Application Security and\n  Development: V-222642</a> - The application must not contain embedded authentication data. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> PostgreSQL Documentation - <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/client-authentication.html\">Client Authentication</a> </li>\n  <li> PostgreSQL Documentation - <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html\">Error Reporting and Logging</a> </li>\n</ul>","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"SonarCloud","guid":null,"version":null},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"(default)","environment":"{}","category":"","state":"open","commit_sha":"352a0f095f452805c5c8d87e38f2319009a43953","message":{"text":"<!--SONAR_ISSUE_KEY:AYon60wrEE7vREjk4-rG-->Make sure this PostgreSQL database password gets changed and removed from the code. <p>See more on <a href=\"https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=MTES-MCT_mobilic-api&issues=AYon60wrEE7vREjk4-rG&open=AYon60wrEE7vREjk4-rG\">SonarQube Cloud</a></p>"},"location":{"path":"config.py","start_line":164,"end_line":164,"start_column":36,"end_column":48},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/code-scanning/alerts/13/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null}]},{"url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/mobilic","grade":"A","alerts":[]}]}
