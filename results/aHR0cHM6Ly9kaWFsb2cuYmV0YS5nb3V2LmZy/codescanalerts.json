This violates the least privileged principle and increases the impact of a potential vulnerability affecting the workflow.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nOnly pass those secrets that are needed by the workflow. Avoid using expressions such as `toJSON(secrets)` or dynamically accessed secrets such as `secrets[format('GH_PAT_%s', matrix.env)]` since the workflow will need to receive all secrets to decide at runtime which one needs to be used.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Incorrect Usage\n\n```yaml\nenv:\n  ALL_SECRETS: ${{ toJSON(secrets) }}\n```\n\n```yaml\nstrategy:\n  matrix:\n    env: [PROD, DEV]\nenv:\n  GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets[format('GH_PAT_%s', matrix.env)] }}\n```\n\n### Correct Usage\n\n```yaml\nenv:\n  NEEDED_SECRET: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}\n```\n\n```yaml\nstrategy:\n  matrix:\n    env: [PROD, DEV]\n---\nif: matrix.env == \"PROD\"\nenv:\n  GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT_PROD }}\n---\nif: matrix.env == \"DEV\"\nenv:\n  GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT_DEV }}\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow)\n- [Job uses all secrets](https://github.com/boostsecurityio/poutine/blob/main/docs/content/en/rules/job_all_secrets.md)\n"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.21.1"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:actions\",\"language\":\"actions\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-22.04\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:actions","state":"open","commit_sha":"c4745bf2a79e47f58436624b2cb22c6ad48dd914","message":{"text":"All organization and repository secrets are passed to the workflow runner in toJson(secrets)"},"location":{"path":".github/workflows/litteralis_import.yml","start_line":70,"end_line":70,"start_column":25,"end_column":47},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/dialog/code-scanning/alerts/10/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":9,"created_at":"2025-04-24T08:12:04Z","updated_at":"2025-04-24T08:12:05Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/dialog/code-scanning/alerts/9","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/dialog/security/code-scanning/9","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"actions/missing-workflow-permissions","severity":"warning","description":"Workflow does not contain permissions","name":"actions/missing-workflow-permissions","tags":["actions","external/cwe/cwe-275","maintainability","security"],"full_description":"Workflows should contain permissions to provide a clear understanding has permissions to run the workflow.","help":"# Actions Job and Workflow Permissions are not set\n\n## Description\n\nIf a GitHub Actions job or workflow has no explicit permissions set, then the repository permissions are used.
