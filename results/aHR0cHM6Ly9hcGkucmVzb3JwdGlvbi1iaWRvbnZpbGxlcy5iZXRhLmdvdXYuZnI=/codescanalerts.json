cross-site scripting vulnerability.\n\nThis kind of vulnerability is also called *DOM-based* cross-site scripting, to distinguish it from other types of cross-site scripting.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing user input to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the references.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows part of the page URL being written directly to the document, leaving the website vulnerable to cross-site scripting.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction setLanguageOptions() {\n    var href = document.location.href,\n        deflt = href.substring(href.indexOf(\"default=\")+8);\n    document.write(\"<OPTION value=1>\"+deflt+\"</OPTION>\");\n    document.write(\"<OPTION value=2>English</OPTION>\");\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat

cross-site scripting vulnerability.\n\nThis kind of vulnerability is also called *DOM-based* cross-site scripting, to distinguish it from other types of cross-site scripting.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing user input to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the references.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows part of the page URL being written directly to the document, leaving the website vulnerable to cross-site scripting.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction setLanguageOptions() {\n    var href = document.location.href,\n        deflt = href.substring(href.indexOf(\"default=\")+8);\n    document.write(\"<OPTION

The sequence is not truly random because it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values, the seed. If the random number generator is cryptographically weak, then this sequence may be easily predictable through outside observations.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator if the output is to be used in a security-sensitive context. As a rule of thumb, a value should be considered \"security-sensitive\" if predicting it would allow the attacker to perform an action that they would otherwise be unable to perform. For example, if an attacker could predict the random password generated for a new user, they would be able to log in as that new user.\n\nFor JavaScript on the NodeJS platform, `crypto.getRandomBytes` provides a cryptographically secure pseudo-random byte generator. Note that the conversion from bytes to numbers can introduce bias that breaks the security.\n\nFor JavaScript in the browser, `crypto.getRandomValues` provides a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following examples show different ways of generating a password.\n\nIn the first case, we generate a fresh password by appending a random integer to the end of a static string. The random number generator used (`Math.random`) is not cryptographically secure, so it may be possible for an attacker to predict the generated password.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction insecurePassword() {\n    // BAD: the random suffix is not cryptographically secure\n    var suffix = Math.random();\n    var password = \"myPassword\" + suffix;\n    return password;\n}\n\n```\nIn the second example, a cryptographically secure random number generator is used for the same purpose.

The sequence is not truly random because it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values, the seed. If the random number generator is cryptographically weak, then this sequence may be easily predictable through outside observations.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator if the output is to be used in a security-sensitive context. As a rule of thumb, a value should be considered \"security-sensitive\" if predicting it would allow the attacker to perform an action that they would otherwise be unable to perform. For example, if an attacker could predict the random password generated for a new user, they would be able to log in as that new user.\n\nFor JavaScript on the NodeJS platform, `crypto.getRandomBytes` provides a cryptographically secure pseudo-random byte generator.
