Repositories created under organizations inherit the organization permissions. The organizations or repositories created before February 2023 have the default permissions set to read-write. Often these permissions do not adhere to the principle of least privilege and can be reduced to read-only, leaving the `write` permission only to a specific types as `issues: write` or `pull-requests: write`.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nAdd the `permissions` key to the job or the root of workflow (in this case it is applied to all jobs in the workflow that do not have their own `permissions` key) and assign the least privileges required to complete the task.\n\n## Example\n\n### Incorrect Usage\n\n```yaml\nname: \"My workflow\"\n# No permissions block\n```\n\n### Correct Usage\n\n```yaml\nname: \"My workflow\"\npermissions:\n  contents: read\n  pull-requests: write\n```\n\nor\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  my-job:\n    permissions:\n      contents: read\n      pull-requests: write\n```\n\n## References\n\n- GitHub Docs: [Assigning permissions to jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/assigning-permissions-to-jobs).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.23.1"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/develop","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:upload","environment":"{}","category":"/language:actions","state":"open","commit_sha":"fbcdec1118ac8d7501cd837c6913d28a5e7abdec","message":{"text":"Actions job or workflow does not limit the permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN.
