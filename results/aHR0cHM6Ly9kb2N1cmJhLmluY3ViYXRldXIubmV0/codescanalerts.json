Whenever that error message occurs for an end user, the developer can use the stack trace to help identify how to fix the problem. In particular, stack traces can tell the developer more about the sequence of events that led to a failure, as opposed to merely the final state of the software when the error occurred.\n\nUnfortunately, the same information can be useful to an attacker. The sequence of function names in a stack trace can reveal the structure of the application as well as any internal components it relies on. Furthermore, the error message at the top of a stack trace can include information such as server-side file names and SQL code that the application relies on, allowing an attacker to fine-tune a subsequent injection attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nSend the user a more generic error message that reveals less information. Either suppress the stack trace entirely, or log it only on the server.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an exception is caught and its stack trace is sent back to the remote user as part of the HTTP response. As such, the user is able to see a detailed stack trace, which may contain sensitive information.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function onRequest(req, res) {\n  var body;\n  try {\n    body = handleRequest(req);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    res.statusCode = 500;\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n    res.end(err.stack); // NOT OK\n    return;\n  }\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Length\", body.length);\n  res.end(body);\n}).listen(3000);\n\n```\nInstead, the stack trace should be logged only on the server. That way, the developers can still access and use the error log, but remote users will not see the information:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function onRequest(req, res) {\n  var body;\n  try {\n    body = handleRequest(req);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    res.statusCode = 500;\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n    log(\"Exception occurred\", err.stack);\n    res.end(\"An exception occurred\"); // OK\n    return;\n  }\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Length\", body.length);\n  res.end(body);\n}).listen(3000);\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Improper Error Handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-209](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-497](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/497.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.1"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"e20dd7d90eae9a0bf09a8655ccc06f6430be0861","message":{"text":"This information exposed to the user depends on stack trace information."},"location":{"path":"server-middleware/trames.js","start_line":165,"end_line":165,"start_column":26,"end_column":29},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/32/instances"},{"number":31,"created_at":"2024-10-10T07:08:30Z","updated_at":"2024-12-26T07:27:09Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/31","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/Docurba/security/code-scanning/31","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/stack-trace-exposure","severity":"warning","description":"Information exposure through a stack trace","name":"js/stack-trace-exposure","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-209","external/cwe/cwe-497","security"],"full_description":"Propagating stack trace information to an external user can unintentionally reveal implementation details that are useful to an attacker for developing a subsequent exploit.","help":"# Information exposure through a stack trace\nSoftware developers often add stack traces to error messages, as a debugging aid.

Furthermore, the error message at the top of a stack trace can include information such as server-side file names and SQL code that the application relies on, allowing an attacker to fine-tune a subsequent injection attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nSend the user a more generic error message that reveals less information. Either suppress the stack trace entirely, or log it only on the server.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an exception is caught and its stack trace is sent back to the remote user as part of the HTTP response. As such, the user is able to see a detailed stack trace, which may contain sensitive information.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function onRequest(req, res) {\n  var body;\n  try {\n    body = handleRequest(req);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    res.statusCode = 500;\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n    res.end(err.stack); // NOT OK\n    return;\n  }\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Length\", body.length);\n  res.end(body);\n}).listen(3000);\n\n```\nInstead, the stack trace should be logged only on the server. That way, the developers can still access and use the error log, but remote users will not see the information:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function onRequest(req, res) {\n  var body;\n  try {\n    body = handleRequest(req);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    res.statusCode = 500;\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n    log(\"Exception occurred\", err.stack);\n    res.end(\"An exception occurred\"); // OK\n    return;\n  }\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Length\", body.length);\n  res.end(body);\n}).listen(3000);\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Improper Error Handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-209](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-497](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/497.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.1"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"e20dd7d90eae9a0bf09a8655ccc06f6430be0861","message":{"text":"This information exposed to the user depends on stack trace information."},"location":{"path":"server-middleware/geoide.js","start_line":42,"end_line":42,"start_column":26,"end_column":29},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/26/instances"},{"number":25,"created_at":"2024-10-10T07:08:30Z","updated_at":"2024-12-26T07:27:09Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/25","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/Docurba/security/code-scanning/25","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/request-forgery","severity":"error","description":"Server-side request forgery","name":"js/request-forgery","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-918","security"],"full_description":"Making a network request with user-controlled data in the URL allows for request forgery attacks.","help":"# Server-side request forgery\nDirectly incorporating user input in the URL of an outgoing HTTP request can enable a request forgery attack, in which the request is altered to target an unintended API endpoint or resource.

But if an attacker sends multiple request parameters with the same name, then the request parameter is represented as an array instead.\n\nIn the following example, a sanitizer checks that a path does not contain the `\"..\"` string, which would allow an attacker to access content outside a user-accessible directory.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar app = require(\"express\")(),\n  path = require(\"path\");\n\napp.get(\"/user-files\", function(req, res) {\n  var file = req.param(\"file\");\n  if (file.indexOf(\"..\") !== -1) {\n    // BAD\n    // we forbid relative paths that contain ..\n    // as these could leave the public directory\n    res.status(400).send(\"Bad request\");\n  } else {\n    var absolute = path.resolve(\"/public/\" + file);\n    console.log(\"Sending file: %s\", absolute);\n    res.sendFile(absolute);\n  }\n});\n\n```\nAs written, this sanitizer is ineffective: an array like `[\"../\", \"/../secret.txt\"]` will bypass the sanitizer. The array does not contain `\"..\"` as an element, so the call to `indexOf` returns `-1` . This is problematic since the value of the `absolute` variable then ends up being `\"/secret.txt\"`. This happens since the concatenation of `\"/public/\"` and the array results in `\"/public/../,/../secret.txt\"`, which the `resolve`-call converts to `\"/secret.txt\"`.\n\nTo fix the sanitizer, check that the request parameter is a string, and not an array:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar app = require(\"express\")(),\n  path = require(\"path\");\n\napp.get(\"/user-files\", function(req, res) {\n  var file = req.param(\"file\");\n  if (typeof file !== 'string' || file.indexOf(\"..\") !== -1) {\n    // GOOD\n    // we forbid relative paths that contain ..\n    // as these could leave the public directory\n    res.status(400).send(\"Bad request\");\n  } else {\n    var absolute = path.resolve(\"/public/\" + file);\n    console.log(\"Sending file: %s\", absolute);\n    res.sendFile(absolute);\n  }\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Node.js API: [querystring](https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-843](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/843.html).\n","security_severity_level":"critical"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.1"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"e20dd7d90eae9a0bf09a8655ccc06f6430be0861","message":{"text":"Potential type confusion as this HTTP request parameter may be either an array or a string."},"location":{"path":"server-middleware/communes.js","start_line":21,"end_line":21,"start_column":31,"end_column":41},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/20/instances"},{"number":19,"created_at":"2024-10-10T07:08:30Z","updated_at":"2024-12-26T07:27:09Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/19","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/Docurba/security/code-scanning/19","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/xss-through-exception","severity":"warning","description":"Exception text reinterpreted as HTML","name":"js/xss-through-exception","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-079","external/cwe/cwe-116","security"],"full_description":"Reinterpreting text from an exception as HTML can lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.","help":"# Exception text reinterpreted as HTML\nDirectly writing error messages to a webpage without sanitization allows for a cross-site scripting vulnerability if parts of the error message can be influenced by a user.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing user input to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the references.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an exception being written directly to the document, and this exception can potentially be influenced by the page URL, leaving the website vulnerable to cross-site scripting.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction setLanguageOptions() {\n    var href = document.location.href,\n        deflt = href.substring(href.indexOf(\"default=\")+8);\n    \n    try {\n        var parsed = unknownParseFunction(deflt); \n    } catch(e) {\n        document.write(\"Had an error: \" + e + \".\");\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## Example\nThis second example shows an input being validated using the JSON schema validator `ajv`, and in case of an error, the error message is sent directly back in the response.\n\n\n```javascript\nimport express from 'express';\nimport Ajv from 'ajv';\n\nlet app = express();\nlet ajv = new Ajv();\n\najv.addSchema({type: 'object', additionalProperties: {type: 'number'}}, 'pollData');\n\napp.post('/polldata', (req, res) => {\n    if (!ajv.validate('pollData', req.body)) {\n        res.send(ajv.errorsText());\n    }\n});\n\n```\nThis is unsafe, because the error message can contain parts of the input. For example, the input `{'<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>': 'foo'}` will generate the error `data/<img src=x onerror=alert(1)> should be number`, causing reflected XSS.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP [DOM Based XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/DOM_Based_XSS).\n* OWASP [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.1"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"e20dd7d90eae9a0bf09a8655ccc06f6430be0861","message":{"text":"Exception text is reinterpreted as HTML without escaping meta-characters.\nException text is reinterpreted as HTML without escaping meta-characters."},"location":{"path":"server-middleware/trames.js","start_line":165,"end_line":165,"start_column":26,"end_column":29},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/19/instances"},{"number":18,"created_at":"2024-10-10T07:08:30Z","updated_at":"2024-12-26T07:27:09Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/18","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/Docurba/security/code-scanning/18","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization","severity":"warning","description":"Incomplete URL substring sanitization","name":"js/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization","tags":["correctness","external/cwe/cwe-020","security"],"full_description":"Security checks on the substrings of an unparsed URL are often vulnerable to bypassing.","help":"# Incomplete URL substring sanitization\nSanitizing untrusted URLs is an important technique for preventing attacks such as request forgeries and malicious redirections.

In these attacks, unsuspecting users can be redirected to a malicious site that looks very similar to the real site they intend to visit, but which is controlled by the attacker.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against untrusted URL redirection, it is advisable to avoid putting user input directly into a redirect URL. Instead, maintain a list of authorized redirects on the server; then choose from that list based on the user input provided.\n\nIf this is not possible, then the user input should be validated in some other way, for example, by verifying that the target URL is on the same host as the current page.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in a URL redirect without validating the input, which facilitates phishing attacks:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\napp.get(\"/redirect\", function (req, res) {\n  // BAD: a request parameter is incorporated without validation into a URL redirect\n  res.redirect(req.query[\"target\"]);\n});\n\n```\nOne way to remedy the problem is to validate the user input against a known fixed string before doing the redirection:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\nconst VALID_REDIRECT = \"http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html\";\n\napp.get(\"/redirect\", function (req, res) {\n  // GOOD: the request parameter is validated against a known fixed string\n  let target = req.query[\"target\"];\n  if (VALID_REDIRECT === target) {\n    res.redirect(target);\n  } else {\n    res.redirect(\"/\");\n  }\n});\n\n```\nAlternatively, we can check that the target URL does not redirect to a different host by parsing it relative to a base URL with a known host and verifying that the host stays the same:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\nfunction isLocalUrl(path) {\n  try {\n    return (\n      // TODO: consider substituting your own domain for example.com\n      new URL(path, \"https://example.com\").origin === \"https://example.com\"\n    );\n  } catch (e) {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n\napp.get(\"/redirect\", function (req, res) {\n  // GOOD: check that we don't redirect to a different host\n  let target = req.query[\"target\"];\n  if (isLocalUrl(target)) {\n    res.redirect(target);\n  } else {\n    res.redirect(\"/\");\n  }\n});\n\n```\nNote that as written, the above code will allow redirects to URLs on `example.com`, which is harmless but perhaps not intended. You can substitute your own domain (if known) for `example.com` to prevent this.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [ XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.1"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"e20dd7d90eae9a0bf09a8655ccc06f6430be0861","message":{"text":"Untrusted URL redirection depends on a user-provided value."},"location":{"path":"server-middleware/redirects.js","start_line":17,"end_line":17,"start_column":23,"end_column":71},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/16/instances"}]}]}
