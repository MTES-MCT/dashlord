regular expression with unsanitized user input is dangerous as a malicious user may be able to modify the meaning of the expression. In particular, such a user may be able to provide a regular expression fragment that takes exponential time in the worst case, and use that to perform a Denial of Service attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nBefore embedding user input into a regular expression, use a sanitization function such as lodash's `_.escapeRegExp` to escape meta-characters that have special meaning.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a HTTP request parameter that is used to construct a regular expression without sanitizing it first:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\napp.get('/findKey', function(req, res) {\n  var key = req.param(\"key\"), input = req.param(\"input\");\n\n  // BAD: Unsanitized user input is used to construct a regular expression\n  var re = new RegExp(\"\\\\b\" + key + \"=(.*)\\n\");\n});\n\n```\nInstead, the request parameter should be sanitized first, for example using the function `_.escapeRegExp` from the lodash package. This ensures that the user cannot insert characters which have a special meaning in regular expressions.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar _ = require('lodash');\nvar app = express();\n\napp.get('/findKey', function(req, res) {\n  var key = req.param(\"key\"), input = req.param(\"input\");\n\n  // GOOD: User input is sanitized before constructing the regex\n  var safeKey = _.escapeRegExp(key);\n  var re = new RegExp(\"\\\\b\" + safeKey + \"=(.*)\\n\");\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* npm: [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.22.2"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/dev","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"cd7d620f2f34031bdfd1a18fbf3165d2461d03da","message":{"text":"This regular expression is constructed from a environment variable."},"location":{"path":"back/src/__tests__/auth.integration.ts","start_line":18,"end_line":20,"start_column":3,"end_column":49},"classifications":["test"]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/trackdechets/code-scanning/alerts/264/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":177,"created_at":"2025-04-23T05:53:06Z","updated_at":"2025-04-23T05:53:08Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/trackdechets/code-scanning/alerts/177","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/trackdechets/security/code-scanning/177","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"actions/unpinned-tag","severity":"warning","description":"Unpinned tag for a non-immutable Action in workflow","name":"actions/unpinned-tag","tags":["actions","external/cwe/cwe-829","security"],"full_description":"Using a tag for a non-immutable Action that is not pinned to a commit can lead to executing an untrusted Action through a supply chain attack.","help":"## Overview\n\nUsing a tag for a 3rd party Action that is not pinned to a commit can lead to executing an untrusted Action through a supply chain attack.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nPinning an action to a full length commit SHA is currently the only way to use a non-immutable action as an immutable release. Pinning to a particular SHA helps mitigate the risk of a bad actor adding a backdoor to the action's repository, as they would need to generate a SHA-1 collision for a valid Git object payload.

These checks usually take a file name to be checked, and if the check returns positively, then the file is opened or otherwise operated upon.\n\nHowever, in the time between the check and the operation, the underlying file referenced by the file name could be changed by an attacker, causing unexpected behavior.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse file descriptors instead of file names whenever possible.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a case where the code checks whether a file inside the `/tmp/` folder exists, and if it doesn't, the file is written to that location.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\nconst os = require(\"os\");\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nconst filePath = path.join(os.tmpdir(), \"my-temp-file.txt\");\n\nif (!fs.existsSync(filePath)) {\n  fs.writeFileSync(filePath, \"Hello\", { mode: 0o600 });\n}\n\n```\nHowever, in a multi-user environment the file might be created by another user between the existence check and the write.\n\nThis can be avoided by using `fs.open` to get a file descriptor, and then use that file descriptor in the write operation.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\nconst os = require(\"os\");\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nconst filePath = path.join(os.tmpdir(), \"my-temp-file.txt\");\n\ntry {\n  const fd = fs.openSync(filePath, fs.O_CREAT | fs.O_EXCL | fs.O_RDWR, 0o600);\n\n  fs.writeFileSync(fd, \"Hello\");\n} catch (e) {\n  // file existed\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [Time-of-check to time-of-use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use).\n* The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for C: [ FIO01-C.
