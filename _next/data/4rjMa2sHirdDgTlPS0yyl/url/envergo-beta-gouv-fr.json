a cross-site scripting vulnerability.","help":"# Reflected server-side cross-site scripting\nDirectly writing user input (for example, an HTTP request parameter) to a webpage without properly sanitizing the input first, allows for a cross-site scripting vulnerability.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider escaping the input before writing user input to the page. The standard library provides escaping functions: `html.escape()` for Python 3.2 upwards or `cgi.escape()` older versions of Python. Most frameworks also provide their own escaping functions, for example `flask.escape()`.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example is a minimal flask app which shows a safe and unsafe way to render the given name back to the page. The first view is unsafe as `first_name` is not escaped, leaving the page vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. The second view is safe as `first_name` is escaped, so it is not vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, make_response, escape\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/unsafe')\ndef unsafe():\n    first_name = request.args.get('name', '')\n    return make_response(\"Your name is \" + first_name)\n\n@app.route('/safe')\ndef safe():\n    first_name = request.args.get('name', '')\n    return make_response(\"Your name is \" + escape(first_name))\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* Python Library Reference: [html.escape()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.22.2"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:python\",\"language\":\"python\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:python","state":"open","commit_sha":"cb1396c4f6469a12472cced368c6ae2ecc8a208b","message":{"text":"Cross-site scripting vulnerability due to a user-provided value."},"location":{"path":"envergo/petitions/views.py","start_line":648,"end_line":648,"start_column":17,"end_column":24},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/19/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":18,"created_at":"2025-06-09T14:20:20Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T09:20:16Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/18","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/envergo/security/code-scanning/18","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/xss-through-dom","severity":"warning","description":"DOM text reinterpreted as HTML","name":"js/xss-through-dom","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-079","external/cwe/cwe-116","security"],"full_description":"Reinterpreting text from the DOM as HTML can lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.","help":"# DOM text reinterpreted as HTML\nExtracting text from a DOM node and interpreting it as HTML can lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.\n\nA webpage with this vulnerability reads text from the DOM, and afterwards adds the text as HTML to the DOM. Using text from the DOM as HTML effectively unescapes the text, and thereby invalidates any escaping done on the text. If an attacker is able to control the safe sanitized text, then this vulnerability can be exploited to perform a cross-site scripting attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing text to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the References section below.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a webpage using a `data-target` attribute to select and manipulate a DOM element using the JQuery library. In the example, the `data-target` attribute is read into the `target` variable, and the `$` function is then supposed to use the `target` variable as a CSS selector to determine which element should be manipulated.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n    $(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\nHowever, if an attacker can control the `data-target` attribute, then the value of `target` can be used to cause the `$` function to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThe above vulnerability can be fixed by using `$.find` instead of `$`. The `$.find` function will only interpret `target` as a CSS selector and never as HTML, thereby preventing an XSS attack.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n\t$.find(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP [DOM Based XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS).\n* OWASP [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.22.2"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"cb1396c4f6469a12472cced368c6ae2ecc8a208b","message":{"text":"DOM text is reinterpreted as HTML without escaping meta-characters."},"location":{"path":"envergo/static/js/libs/hedges_input.js","start_line":38,"end_line":38,"start_column":18,"end_column":32},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/18/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":17,"created_at":"2025-04-23T09:56:50Z","updated_at":"2025-04-23T09:56:50Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/17","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/envergo/security/code-scanning/17","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"actions/missing-workflow-permissions","severity":"warning","description":"Workflow does not contain permissions","name":"actions/missing-workflow-permissions","tags":["actions","external/cwe/cwe-275","maintainability","security"],"full_description":"Workflows should contain explicit permissions to restrict the scope of the default GITHUB_TOKEN.","help":"## Overview\n\nIf a GitHub Actions job or workflow has no explicit permissions set, then the repository permissions are used.

Using text from the DOM as HTML effectively unescapes the text, and thereby invalidates any escaping done on the text. If an attacker is able to control the safe sanitized text, then this vulnerability can be exploited to perform a cross-site scripting attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing text to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the References section below.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a webpage using a `data-target` attribute to select and manipulate a DOM element using the JQuery library. In the example, the `data-target` attribute is read into the `target` variable, and the `$` function is then supposed to use the `target` variable as a CSS selector to determine which element should be manipulated.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n    $(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\nHowever, if an attacker can control the `data-target` attribute, then the value of `target` can be used to cause the `$` function to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThe above vulnerability can be fixed by using `$.find` instead of `$`. The `$.find` function will only interpret `target` as a CSS selector and never as HTML, thereby preventing an XSS attack.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n\t$.find(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP [DOM Based XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS).\n* OWASP [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.22.2"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"cb1396c4f6469a12472cced368c6ae2ecc8a208b","message":{"text":"DOM text is reinterpreted as HTML without escaping meta-characters."},"location":{"path":"envergo/templates/admin/choice_filter.html","start_line":5,"end_line":5,"start_column":37,"end_column":47},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/3/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":2,"created_at":"2022-09-30T08:30:14Z","updated_at":"2023-05-15T08:40:14Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/2","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/envergo/security/code-scanning/2","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"pythonsecurity:S5145","severity":"warning","description":"Logging should not be vulnerable to injection attacks","name":"pythonsecurity:S5145","tags":["cwe"],"full_description":"Logging should not be vulnerable to injection attacks","help":"<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>\n<p>Log injection occurs when an application fails to sanitize untrusted data used for logging.</p>\n<p>An attacker can forge log content to prevent an organization from being able to trace back malicious activities.</p>\n<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>\n<p>If an attacker can insert arbitrary data into a log file, the integrity of the chain of events being recorded can be compromised.<br> This\nfrequently occurs because attackers can inject the log entry separator of the logger framework, commonly newlines, and thus insert artificial log\nentries. <br> Other attacks could also occur requiring only field pollution, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or code injection (for example,\nLog4Shell) if the logged data is fed to other application components, which may interpret the injected data differently.<br></p>\n<p>The focus of this rule is newline character replacement.</p>\n<h4>Log Forge</h4>\n<p>An attacker, able to create independent log entries by injecting log entry separators, inserts bogus data into a log file to conceal his malicious\nactivities.
