database passwords should not be disclosed","name":"secrets:S6698","tags":["cwe"],"full_description":"PostgreSQL database passwords should not be disclosed","help":"<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source\ncode is intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get\nexposed to an unintended audience.</p>\n<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>\n<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.\nUnintended people who don’t need to know the secret might get access to it. They might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated\nservices or resources.</p>\n<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people’s role and entitlement.</p>\n<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>\n<p>Passwords in PostgreSQL are used to authenticate users against the database engine. They are associated with user accounts that are granted\nspecific permissions over the database and its hosted data.</p>\n<p>If a PostgreSQL password leaks to an unintended audience, it can have serious consequences for the security of your database, the data stored\nwithin it, and the applications that rely on it.</p>\n<h4>Compromise of sensitive data</h4>\n<p>If the affected service is used to store or process personally identifiable information or other sensitive data, attackers knowing an\nauthentication secret could be able to access it. Depending on the type of data that is compromised, it could lead to privacy violations, identity\ntheft, financial loss, or other negative outcomes.</p>\n<p>In most cases, a company suffering a sensitive data compromise will face a reputational loss when the security issue is publicly disclosed.</p>\n<h4>Security downgrade</h4>\n<p>Applications relying on a PostgreSQL database instance can suffer a security downgrade if an access password is leaked to attackers. Depending on\nthe purposes the application uses the database for, consequences can range from low-severity issues, like defacement, to complete compromise.</p>\n<p>For example, if the PostgreSQL instance is used as part of the authentication process of an application, attackers with access to the database will\nlikely be able to bypass this security mechanism.</p>\n<h2>How to fix it</h2>\n<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>\n<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>\n<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the\nsecret is revoked.</p>\n<p><strong>Analyze recent secret use</strong></p>\n<p>When available, analyze authentication logs to identify any unintended or malicious use of the secret since its disclosure date. Doing this will\nallow determining if an attacker took advantage of the leaked secret and to what extent.</p>\n<p>This operation should be part of a global incident response process.</p>\n<p>By default, no connection information is logged by PostgreSQL server. The <code>log_connections</code> parameter must be set to <code>true</code>\nin the server configuration for this to happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>\n<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret.

Still, two main scenarios should be considered.</p>\n<h4>Financial loss</h4>\n<p>Financial losses can occur when a secret is used to access a paid third-party-provided service and is disclosed as part of the source code of\nclient applications.

This might result in a partial denial of service for all the application’s users.</p>\n<h4>Application’s security downgrade</h4>\n<p>A downgrade can happen when the disclosed secret is used to protect security-sensitive assets or features of the application. Depending on the\naffected asset or feature, the practical impact can range from a sensitive information leak to a complete takeover of the application, its hosting\nserver or another linked component.</p>\n<p>For example, an application that would disclose a secret used to sign user authentication tokens would be at risk of user identity impersonation.\nAn attacker accessing the leaked secret could sign session tokens for arbitrary users and take over their privileges and entitlements.</p>\n<h3>Exceptions</h3>\n<p>In multi-stage builds, the rule only scans instructions that are part of the final image.</p>\n<h2>How to fix it</h2>\n<p>Best practices recommend using a secret vault for all secrets that must be accessed at container runtime.

Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple solutions are currently\navailable.</p>\n<p>For all secrets that must be accessed at image build time, it is recommended to rely on Docker Buildkit’s secret mount options. This will prevent\nsecrets from being disclosed in image’s metadata and build logs.</p>\n<p>Additionally, investigations and remediation actions should be conducted to ensure the current and future security of the infrastructure.</p>\n<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>\n<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>\n<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are using it.
