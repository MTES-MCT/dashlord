The sequence is not truly random because it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values, the seed. If the random number generator is cryptographically weak, then this sequence may be easily predictable through outside observations.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator if the output is to be used in a security-sensitive context. As a rule of thumb, a value should be considered \"security-sensitive\" if predicting it would allow the attacker to perform an action that they would otherwise be unable to perform. For example, if an attacker could predict the random password generated for a new user, they would be able to log in as that new user.\n\nFor JavaScript on the NodeJS platform, `crypto.getRandomBytes` provides a cryptographically secure pseudo-random byte generator. Note that the conversion from bytes to numbers can introduce bias that breaks the security.\n\nFor JavaScript in the browser, `crypto.getRandomValues` provides a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following examples show different ways of generating a password.\n\nIn the first case, we generate a fresh password by appending a random integer to the end of a static string. The random number generator used (`Math.random`) is not cryptographically secure, so it may be possible for an attacker to predict the generated password.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction insecurePassword() {\n    // BAD: the random suffix is not cryptographically secure\n    var suffix = Math.random();\n    var password = \"myPassword\" + suffix;\n    return password;\n}\n\n```\nIn the second example, a cryptographically secure random number generator is used for the same purpose. In this case, it is much harder to predict the generated integers.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction securePassword() {\n    // GOOD: the random suffix is cryptographically secure\n    var suffix = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(1))[0];\n    var password = \"myPassword\" + suffix;\n    \n    // GOOD: if a random value between 0 and 1 is desired\n    var secret = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(1))[0] * Math.pow(2,-32);\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [Pseudo-random number generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator).\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [Crypto: getRandomValues()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/getRandomValues).\n* NodeJS: [crypto.randomBytes](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_randombytes_size_callback)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-338](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html).\n","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.4"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/develop","analysis_key":".github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml:analyze","environment":"{\"language\":\"javascript\"}","category":".github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml:analyze/language:javascript","state":"open","commit_sha":"3021f1492fe34d08c58b17fd60f4f45b17818125","message":{"text":"This uses a cryptographically insecure random number generated at Math.random() in a security context."},"location":{"path":"packages/api/test/utils/shantytown.ts","start_line":12,"end_line":12,"start_column":20,"end_column":45},"classifications":["test"]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/resorption-bidonvilles/code-scanning/alerts/123/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":122,"created_at":"2024-06-05T14:23:17Z","updated_at":"2024-06-05T14:44:39Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/resorption-bidonvilles/code-scanning/alerts/122","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/resorption-bidonvilles/security/code-scanning/122","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/insecure-randomness","severity":"warning","description":"Insecure randomness","name":"js/insecure-randomness","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-338","security"],"full_description":"Using a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator to generate a security-sensitive value may allow an attacker to predict what value will be generated.","help":"# Insecure randomness\nUsing a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator to generate a security-sensitive value, such as a password, makes it easier for an attacker to predict the value.\n\nPseudo-random number generators generate a sequence of numbers that only approximates the properties of random numbers. The sequence is not truly random because it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values, the seed. If the random number generator is cryptographically weak, then this sequence may be easily predictable through outside observations.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator if the output is to be used in a security-sensitive context. As a rule of thumb, a value should be considered \"security-sensitive\" if predicting it would allow the attacker to perform an action that they would otherwise be unable to perform. For example, if an attacker could predict the random password generated for a new user, they would be able to log in as that new user.\n\nFor JavaScript on the NodeJS platform, `crypto.getRandomBytes` provides a cryptographically secure pseudo-random byte generator. Note that the conversion from bytes to numbers can introduce bias that breaks the security.\n\nFor JavaScript in the browser, `crypto.getRandomValues` provides a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following examples show different ways of generating a password.\n\nIn the first case, we generate a fresh password by appending a random integer to the end of a static string. The random number generator used (`Math.random`) is not cryptographically secure, so it may be possible for an attacker to predict the generated password.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction insecurePassword() {\n    // BAD: the random suffix is not cryptographically secure\n    var suffix = Math.random();\n    var password = \"myPassword\" + suffix;\n    return password;\n}\n\n```\nIn the second example, a cryptographically secure random number generator is used for the same purpose. In this case, it is much harder to predict the generated integers.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction securePassword() {\n    // GOOD: the random suffix is cryptographically secure\n    var suffix = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(1))[0];\n    var password = \"myPassword\" + suffix;\n    \n    // GOOD: if a random value between 0 and 1 is desired\n    var secret = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(1))[0] * Math.pow(2,-32);\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [Pseudo-random number
