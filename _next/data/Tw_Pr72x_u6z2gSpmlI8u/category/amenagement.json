URL substring sanitization","name":"js/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization","tags":["correctness","external/cwe/cwe-020","security"],"full_description":"Security checks on the substrings of an unparsed URL are often vulnerable to bypassing.","help":"# Incomplete URL substring sanitization\nSanitizing untrusted URLs is an important technique for preventing attacks such as request forgeries and malicious redirections. Usually, this is done by checking that the host of a URL is in a set of allowed hosts.\n\nHowever, treating the URL as a string and checking if one of the allowed hosts is a substring of the URL is very prone to errors. Malicious URLs can bypass such security checks by embedding one of the allowed hosts in an unexpected location.\n\nEven if the substring check is not used in a security-critical context, the incomplete check may still cause undesirable behaviors when the check succeeds accidentally.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nParse a URL before performing a check on its host value, and ensure that the check handles arbitrary subdomain sequences correctly.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code checks that a URL redirection will reach the `example.com` domain, or one of its subdomains, and not some malicious site.\n\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {\n    let url = req.param(\"url\");\n    // BAD: the host of `url` may be controlled by an attacker\n    if (url.includes(\"example.com\")) {\n        res.redirect(url);\n    }\n});\n\n```\nThe substring check is, however, easy to bypass.

In a type confusion attack, an attacker tampers with an HTTP request parameter such that it has a value of type `Array` instead of the expected type `String`.

But if an attacker sends multiple request parameters with the same name, then the request parameter is represented as an array instead.\n\nIn the following example, a sanitizer checks that a path does not contain the `\"..\"` string, which would allow an attacker to access content outside a user-accessible directory.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar app = require(\"express\")(),\n  path = require(\"path\");\n\napp.get(\"/user-files\", function(req, res) {\n  var file = req.param(\"file\");\n  if (file.indexOf(\"..\") !== -1) {\n    // BAD\n    // we forbid relative paths that contain ..\n    // as these could leave the public directory\n    res.status(400).send(\"Bad request\");\n  } else {\n    var absolute = path.resolve(\"/public/\" + file);\n    console.log(\"Sending file: %s\", absolute);\n    res.sendFile(absolute);\n  }\n});\n\n```\nAs written, this sanitizer is ineffective: an array like `[\"../\", \"/../secret.txt\"]` will bypass the sanitizer. The array does not contain `\"..\"` as an element, so the call to `indexOf` returns `-1` . This is problematic since the value of the `absolute` variable then ends up being `\"/secret.txt\"`. This happens since the concatenation of `\"/public/\"` and the array results in `\"/public/../,/../secret.txt\"`, which the `resolve`-call converts to `\"/secret.txt\"`.\n\nTo fix the sanitizer, check that the request parameter is a string, and not an array:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar app = require(\"express\")(),\n  path = require(\"path\");\n\napp.get(\"/user-files\", function(req, res) {\n  var file = req.param(\"file\");\n  if (typeof file !== 'string' || file.indexOf(\"..\") !== -1) {\n    // GOOD\n    // we forbid relative paths that contain ..\n    // as these could leave the public directory\n    res.status(400).send(\"Bad request\");\n  } else {\n    var absolute = path.resolve(\"/public/\" + file);\n    console.log(\"Sending file: %s\", absolute);\n    res.sendFile(absolute);\n  }\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Node.js API: [querystring](https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-843](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/843.html).\n","security_severity_level":"critical"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.4"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-22.04\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"214a8d05a5a20d3ec8f94ca2d88d0b02da89f8d8","message":{"text":"Potential type confusion as this HTTP request parameter may be either an array or a string.\nPotential type confusion as this HTTP request parameter may be either an array or a string."},"location":{"path":"nuxt/server-middleware/modules/geo.js","start_line":102,"end_line":102,"start_column":16,"end_column":38},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/48/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":47,"created_at":"2025-02-02T11:32:22Z","updated_at":"2025-02-02T11:34:19Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/47","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/Docurba/security/code-scanning/47","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/type-confusion-through-parameter-tampering","severity":"error","description":"Type confusion through parameter tampering","name":"js/type-confusion-through-parameter-tampering","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-843","security"],"full_description":"Sanitizing an HTTP request parameter may be ineffective if the user controls its type.","help":"# Type confusion through parameter tampering\nSanitizing untrusted HTTP request parameters is a common technique for preventing injection attacks such as SQL injection or path traversal.

The array does not contain `\"..\"` as an element, so the call to `indexOf` returns `-1` . This is problematic since the value of the `absolute` variable then ends up being `\"/secret.txt\"`. This happens since the concatenation of `\"/public/\"` and the array results in `\"/public/../,/../secret.txt\"`, which the `resolve`-call converts to `\"/secret.txt\"`.\n\nTo fix the sanitizer, check that the request parameter is a string, and not an array:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar app = require(\"express\")(),\n  path = require(\"path\");\n\napp.get(\"/user-files\", function(req, res) {\n  var file = req.param(\"file\");\n  if (typeof file !== 'string' || file.indexOf(\"..\") !== -1) {\n    // GOOD\n    // we forbid relative paths that contain ..\n    // as these could leave the public directory\n    res.status(400).send(\"Bad request\");\n  } else {\n    var absolute = path.resolve(\"/public/\" + file);\n    console.log(\"Sending file: %s\", absolute);\n    res.sendFile(absolute);\n  }\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Node.js API: [querystring](https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-843](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/843.html).\n","security_severity_level":"critical"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.4"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-22.04\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"214a8d05a5a20d3ec8f94ca2d88d0b02da89f8d8","message":{"text":"Potential type confusion as this HTTP request parameter may be either an array or a string.\nPotential type confusion as this HTTP request parameter may be either an array or a string."},"location":{"path":"nuxt/server-middleware/modules/geo.js","start_line":63,"end_line":63,"start_column":16,"end_column":29},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/47/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":46,"created_at":"2025-02-02T11:32:22Z","updated_at":"2025-02-02T11:34:19Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/46","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/Docurba/security/code-scanning/46","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/type-confusion-through-parameter-tampering","severity":"error","description":"Type confusion through parameter tampering","name":"js/type-confusion-through-parameter-tampering","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-843","security"],"full_description":"Sanitizing an HTTP request parameter may be ineffective if the user controls its type.","help":"# Type confusion through parameter tampering\nSanitizing untrusted HTTP request parameters is a common technique for preventing injection attacks such as SQL injection or path traversal.

In these attacks, unsuspecting users can be redirected to a malicious site that looks very similar to the real site they intend to visit, but which is controlled by the attacker.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against untrusted URL redirection, it is advisable to avoid putting user input directly into a redirect URL. Instead, maintain a list of authorized redirects on the server; then choose from that list based on the user input provided.\n\nIf this is not possible, then the user input should be validated in some other way, for example, by verifying that the target URL is on the same host as the current page.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in a URL redirect without validating the input, which facilitates phishing attacks:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\napp.get(\"/redirect\", function (req, res) {\n  // BAD: a request parameter is incorporated without validation into a URL redirect\n  res.redirect(req.query[\"target\"]);\n});\n\n```\nOne way to remedy the problem is to validate the user input against a known fixed string before doing the redirection:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\nconst VALID_REDIRECT = \"http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html\";\n\napp.get(\"/redirect\", function (req, res) {\n  // GOOD: the request parameter is validated against a known fixed string\n  let target = req.query[\"target\"];\n  if (VALID_REDIRECT === target) {\n    res.redirect(target);\n  } else {\n    res.redirect(\"/\");\n  }\n});\n\n```\nAlternatively, we can check that the target URL does not redirect to a different host by parsing it relative to a base URL with a known host and verifying that the host stays the same:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\nfunction isLocalUrl(path) {\n  try {\n    return (\n      // TODO: consider substituting your own domain for example.com\n      new URL(path, \"https://example.com\").origin === \"https://example.com\"\n    );\n  } catch (e) {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n\napp.get(\"/redirect\", function (req, res) {\n  // GOOD: check that we don't redirect to a different host\n  let target = req.query[\"target\"];\n  if (isLocalUrl(target)) {\n    res.redirect(target);\n  } else {\n    res.redirect(\"/\");\n  }\n});\n\n```\nNote that as written, the above code will allow redirects to URLs on `example.com`, which is harmless but perhaps not intended. You can substitute your own domain (if known) for `example.com` to prevent this.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [ XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.4"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-22.04\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"214a8d05a5a20d3ec8f94ca2d88d0b02da89f8d8","message":{"text":"Untrusted URL redirection depends on a user-provided value."},"location":{"path":"nuxt/server-middleware/redirects.js","start_line":17,"end_line":17,"start_column":23,"end_column":71},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/43/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":42,"created_at":"2025-02-02T11:32:22Z","updated_at":"2025-02-02T11:34:19Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/42","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/Docurba/security/code-scanning/42","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/stack-trace-exposure","severity":"warning","description":"Information exposure through a stack trace","name":"js/stack-trace-exposure","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-209","external/cwe/cwe-497","security"],"full_description":"Propagating stack trace information to an external user can unintentionally reveal implementation details that are useful to an attacker for developing a subsequent exploit.","help":"# Information exposure through a stack trace\nSoftware developers often add stack traces to error messages, as a debugging aid.

Either suppress the stack trace entirely, or log it only on the server.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an exception is caught and its stack trace is sent back to the remote user as part of the HTTP response. As such, the user is able to see a detailed stack trace, which may contain sensitive information.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function onRequest(req, res) {\n  var body;\n  try {\n    body = handleRequest(req);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    res.statusCode = 500;\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n    res.end(err.stack); // NOT OK\n    return;\n  }\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Length\", body.length);\n  res.end(body);\n}).listen(3000);\n\n```\nInstead, the stack trace should be logged only on the server. That way, the developers can still access and use the error log, but remote users will not see the information:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function onRequest(req, res) {\n  var body;\n  try {\n    body = handleRequest(req);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    res.statusCode = 500;\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n    log(\"Exception occurred\", err.stack);\n    res.end(\"An exception occurred\"); // OK\n    return;\n  }\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Length\", body.length);\n  res.end(body);\n}).listen(3000);\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Improper Error Handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-209](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-497](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/497.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.4"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-22.04\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"214a8d05a5a20d3ec8f94ca2d88d0b02da89f8d8","message":{"text":"This information exposed to the user depends on stack trace information."},"location":{"path":"nuxt/server-middleware/trames.js","start_line":155,"end_line":155,"start_column":26,"end_column":29},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/41/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":40,"created_at":"2025-02-02T11:32:22Z","updated_at":"2025-02-02T11:34:19Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/40","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/Docurba/security/code-scanning/40","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/stack-trace-exposure","severity":"warning","description":"Information exposure through a stack trace","name":"js/stack-trace-exposure","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-209","external/cwe/cwe-497","security"],"full_description":"Propagating stack trace information to an external user can unintentionally reveal implementation details that are useful to an attacker for developing a subsequent exploit.","help":"# Information exposure through a stack trace\nSoftware developers often add stack traces to error messages, as a debugging aid.

messages and stack traces, to an external user can expose implementation details that are useful to an attacker for developing a subsequent exploit.","help":"# Information exposure through an exception\nSoftware developers often add stack traces to error messages, as a debugging aid. Whenever that error message occurs for an end user, the developer can use the stack trace to help identify how to fix the problem. In particular, stack traces can tell the developer more about the sequence of events that led to a failure, as opposed to merely the final state of the software when the error occurred.\n\nUnfortunately, the same information can be useful to an attacker. The sequence of class names in a stack trace can reveal the structure of the application as well as any internal components it relies on. Furthermore, the error message at the top of a stack trace can include information such as server-side file names and SQL code that the application relies on, allowing an attacker to fine-tune a subsequent injection attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nSend the user a more generic error message that reveals less information. Either suppress the stack trace entirely, or log it only on the server.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an exception is handled in two different ways. In the first version, labeled BAD, the exception is sent back to the remote user by returning it from the function. As such, the user is able to see a detailed stack trace, which may contain sensitive information. In the second version, the error message is logged only on the server, and a generic error message is displayed to the user.

Using text from the DOM as HTML effectively unescapes the text, and thereby invalidates any escaping done on the text. If an attacker is able to control the safe sanitized text, then this vulnerability can be exploited to perform a cross-site scripting attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing text to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the References section below.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a webpage using a `data-target` attribute to select and manipulate a DOM element using the JQuery library. In the example, the `data-target` attribute is read into the `target` variable, and the `$` function is then supposed to use the `target` variable as a CSS selector to determine which element should be manipulated.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n    $(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\nHowever, if an attacker can control the `data-target` attribute, then the value of `target` can be used to cause the `$` function to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThe above vulnerability can be fixed by using `$.find` instead of `$`. The `$.find` function will only interpret `target` as a CSS selector and never as HTML, thereby preventing an XSS attack.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n\t$.find(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP [DOM Based XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS).\n* OWASP [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.4"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-22.04\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"735937312c5f55570e5025e30869c1b121f2ee10","message":{"text":"DOM text is reinterpreted as HTML without escaping meta-characters."},"location":{"path":"envergo/templates/admin/choice_filter.html","start_line":5,"end_line":5,"start_column":37,"end_column":47},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/3/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":2,"created_at":"2022-09-30T08:30:14Z","updated_at":"2023-05-15T08:40:14Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/2","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/envergo/security/code-scanning/2","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"pythonsecurity:S5145","severity":"warning","description":"Logging should not be vulnerable to injection attacks","name":"pythonsecurity:S5145","tags":["cwe"],"full_description":"Logging should not be vulnerable to injection attacks","help":"<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>\n<p>Log injection occurs when an application fails to sanitize untrusted data used for logging.</p>\n<p>An attacker can forge log content to prevent an organization from being able to trace back malicious activities.</p>\n<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>\n<p>If an attacker can insert arbitrary data into a log file, the integrity of the chain of events being recorded can be compromised.<br> This\nfrequently occurs because attackers can inject the log entry separator of the logger framework, commonly newlines, and thus insert artificial log\nentries. <br> Other attacks could also occur requiring only field pollution, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or code injection (for example,\nLog4Shell) if the logged data is fed to other application components, which may interpret the injected data differently.<br></p>\n<p>The focus of this rule is newline character replacement.</p>\n<h4>Log Forge</h4>\n<p>An attacker, able to create independent log entries by injecting log entry separators, inserts bogus data into a log file to conceal his malicious\nactivities. This obscures the content for an incident response team to trace the origin of the breach as the indicators of compromise (IoCs) lead to\nfake application events.</p>\n<h2>How to fix it in Flask</h2>\n<h3>Code examples</h3>\n<p>The following code is vulnerable to log injection as it constructs log entries using untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this to manipulate\nthe chain of events being recorded.</p>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nimport logging\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/example')\ndef log():\n    data = request.args[\"data\"]\n    app.logger.critical(\"%s\", data) # Noncompliant\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nimport logging\nimport base64\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/example')\ndef log():\n    data = request.args[\"data\"]\n    if data.isalnum():\n        app.logger.critical(\"%s\", data)\n    else:\n        app.logger.critical(\"Invalid Input: %s\", base64.b64encode(data.encode('UTF-8')))\n</pre>\n<h3>How does this work?</h3>\n<p>Data used for logging should be content-restricted and typed. This can be done by validating the data content or sanitizing it.<br> Validation and\nsanitization mainly revolve around preventing carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) characters. However, further actions could be required based on\nthe application context and the logged data usage.</p>\n<p>Here, the example compliant code uses the <code>isalnum</code> function to ensure the untrusted data is safe. If not, it performs Base64 encoding\nto protect from log injection.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<h3>Standards</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/\">OWASP Top 10 2021

cross-site scripting vulnerability.","help":"# DOM text reinterpreted as HTML\nExtracting text from a DOM node and interpreting it as HTML can lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.\n\nA webpage with this vulnerability reads text from the DOM, and afterwards adds the text as HTML to the DOM. Using text from the DOM as HTML effectively unescapes the text, and thereby invalidates any escaping done on the text. If an attacker is able to control the safe sanitized text, then this vulnerability can be exploited to perform a cross-site scripting attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing text to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the References section below.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a webpage using a `data-target` attribute to select and manipulate a DOM element using the JQuery library. In the example, the `data-target` attribute is read into the `target` variable, and the `$` function is then supposed to use the `target` variable as a CSS selector to determine which element should be manipulated.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n    $(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\nHowever, if an attacker can control the `data-target` attribute, then the value of `target` can be used to cause the `$` function to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThe above vulnerability can be fixed by using `$.find` instead of `$`. The `$.find` function will only interpret `target` as a CSS selector and never as HTML, thereby preventing an XSS attack.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n\t$.find(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat
