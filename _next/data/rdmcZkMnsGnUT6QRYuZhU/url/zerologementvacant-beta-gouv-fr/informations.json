sometimes annotated as deprecated by developers maintaining libraries or APIs to indicate that the method, class, or other programming\nelement is no longer recommended for use. This is typically due to the introduction of a newer or more effective alternative. For example, when a\nbetter solution has been identified, or when the existing code presents potential errors or security risks.</p>\n<p>Deprecation is a good practice because it helps to phase out obsolete code in a controlled manner, without breaking existing software that may\nstill depend on it. It is a way to warn other developers not to use the deprecated element in new code, and to replace it in existing code when\npossible.</p>\n<p>Deprecated classes, interfaces, and their members should not be used, inherited or extended because they will eventually be removed.
