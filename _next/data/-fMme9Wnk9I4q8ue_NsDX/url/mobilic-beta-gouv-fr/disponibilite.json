messages and stack traces, to an external user can expose implementation details that are useful to an attacker for developing a subsequent exploit.","help":"# Information exposure through an exception\nSoftware developers often add stack traces to error messages, as a debugging aid. Whenever that error message occurs for an end user, the developer can use the stack trace to help identify how to fix the problem. In particular, stack traces can tell the developer more about the sequence of events that led to a failure, as opposed to merely the final state of the software when the error occurred.\n\nUnfortunately, the same information can be useful to an attacker. The sequence of class names in a stack trace can reveal the structure of the application as well as any internal components it relies on. Furthermore, the error message at the top of a stack trace can include information such as server-side file names and SQL code that the application relies on, allowing an attacker to fine-tune a subsequent injection attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nSend the user a more generic error message that reveals less information. Either suppress the stack trace entirely, or log it only on the server.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an exception is handled in two different ways. In the first version, labeled BAD, the exception is sent back to the remote user by returning it from the function.

For example, you can use the `urlparse` function from the Python standard library to parse the URL and check that the `netloc` attribute is empty.\n\nNote, however, that some cases are not handled as we desire out-of-the-box by `urlparse`, so we need to adjust two things, as shown in the example below:\n\n* Many browsers accept backslash characters (`\\`) as equivalent to forward slash characters (`/`) in URLs, but the `urlparse` function does not.\n* Mistyped URLs such as `https:/example.com` or `https:///example.com` are parsed as having an empty `netloc` attribute, while browsers will still redirect to the correct site.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    target = target.replace('\\\\', '')\n    if not urlparse(target).netloc and not urlparse(target).scheme:\n        # relative path, safe to redirect\n        return redirect(target, code=302)\n    # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n    return redirect('/', code=302)\n\n```\nFor Django application, you can use the function `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme` to check that a URL is safe to redirect to, as shown in the following example:\n\n\n```python\nfrom django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\nfrom django.shortcuts import redirect\nfrom django.utils.http import url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme\nfrom django.views import View\n\nclass RedirectView(View):\n    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n        target = request.GET.get('target', '')\n        if url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme(target, allowed_hosts=None):\n            return HttpResponseRedirect(target)\n        else:\n            # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n            return redirect('/')\n```\nNote that `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme` handles backslashes correctly, so no additional processing is required.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [ XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Python standard library: [ urllib.parse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.22.2"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:python\",\"language\":\"python\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:python","state":"open","commit_sha":"de9b28480bc21dcb073dda4e811267baf4df3920","message":{"text":"Untrusted URL redirection depends on a user-provided value."},"location":{"path":"app/controllers/controller.py","start_line":95,"end_line":95,"start_column":9,"end_column":123},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/code-scanning/alerts/104/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":103,"created_at":"2024-10-10T07:05:40Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T07:05:42Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/code-scanning/alerts/103","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/security/code-scanning/103","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"py/url-redirection","severity":"error","description":"URL redirection from remote source","name":"py/url-redirection","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-601","security"],"full_description":"URL redirection based on unvalidated user input may cause redirection to malicious web sites.","help":"# URL redirection from remote source\nDirectly incorporating user input into a URL redirect request without validating the input can facilitate phishing attacks.

This\nvulnerability class allows malicious actors to craft fraudulent tokens, effectively impersonating user identities. In essence, the integrity of a JWT\nhinges on the strength and presence of its signature.</p>\n<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>\n<p>When a JSON Web Token is not appropriately signed with a strong cipher algorithm or if the signature is not verified, it becomes a significant\nthreat to data security and the privacy of user identities.</p>\n<h4>Impersonation of users</h4>\n<p>JWTs are commonly used to represent user authorization claims. They contain information about the user’s identity, user roles, and access rights.\nWhen these tokens are not securely signed, it allows an attacker to forge them. In essence, a weak or missing signature gives an attacker the power to\ncraft a token that could impersonate any user. For instance, they could create a token for an administrator account, gaining access to high-level\npermissions and sensitive data.</p>\n<h4>Unauthorized data access</h4>\n<p>When a JWT is not securely signed, it can be tampered with by an attacker, and the integrity of the data it carries cannot be trusted. An attacker\ncan manipulate the content of the token and grant themselves permissions they should not have, leading to unauthorized data access.</p>\n<h2>How to fix it in PyJWT</h2>\n<h3>Code examples</h3>\n<p>The following code contains an example of JWT decoding without verification of the signature.</p>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nimport jwt\n\njwt.decode(token, options={\"verify_signature\":False}) # Noncompliant\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<p>By default, verification is enabled for the method <code>decode</code>.</p>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nimport jwt\n\njwt.decode(token, key, algorithms=\"HS256\")\n</pre>\n<h3>How does this work?</h3>\n<h4>Verify the signature of your tokens</h4>\n<p>Resolving a vulnerability concerning the validation of JWT token signatures is mainly about incorporating a critical step into your process:\nvalidating the signature every time a token is decoded. Just having a signed token using a secure algorithm is not enough. If you are not validating\nsignatures, they are not serving their purpose.</p>\n<p>Every time your application receives a JWT, it needs to decode the token to extract the information contained within. It is during this decoding\nprocess that the signature of the JWT should also be checked.</p>\n<p>To resolve the issue, follow these instructions:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li> Use framework-specific functions for signature verification: Most programming frameworks that support JWTs provide specific functions to not\n  only decode a token but also validate its signature simultaneously. Make sure to use these functions when handling incoming tokens. </li>\n  <li> Handle invalid signatures appropriately: If a JWT’s signature does not validate correctly, it means the token is not trustworthy, indicating\n  potential tampering. The action to take when encountering an invalid token should be denying the request carrying it and logging the event for\n  further investigation. </li>\n  <li> Incorporate signature validation in your tests: When you are writing tests for your application, include tests that check the signature\n  validation functionality. This can help you catch any instances where signature verification might be unintentionally skipped or bypassed. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>By following these practices, you can ensure the security of your application’s JWT handling process, making it resistant to attacks that rely on\ntampering with tokens. Validation of the signature needs to be an integral and non-negotiable part of your token handling process.</p>\n<h3>Going the extra mile</h3>\n<h4>Securely store your secret keys</h4>\n<p>Ensure that your secret keys are stored securely. They should not be hard-coded into your application code or checked into your version control\nsystem. Instead, consider using environment variables, secure key management systems, or vault services.</p>\n<h4>Rotate your secret keys</h4>\n<p>Even with the strongest cipher algorithms, there is a risk that your secret keys may be compromised. Therefore, it is a good practice to\nperiodically rotate your secret keys. By doing so, you limit the amount of time that an attacker can misuse a stolen key. When you rotate keys, be\nsure to allow a grace period where tokens signed with the old key are still accepted to prevent service disruptions.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<h3>Standards</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/\">Top 10 2021 Category A2 - Cryptographic Failures</a> </li>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure\">Top 10 2017 Category A3 - Sensitive Data\n  Exposure</a> </li>\n  <li> CWE - <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/347\">CWE-347 - Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature</a> </li>\n</ul>","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"SonarCloud","guid":null,"version":null},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"(default)","environment":"{}","category":"","state":"open","commit_sha":"de9b28480bc21dcb073dda4e811267baf4df3920","message":{"text":"<!--SONAR_ISSUE_KEY:AYyMCM-NLDc9JXTddumE-->Don't use a JWT token without verifying its signature. <p>See more on <a href=\"https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=MTES-MCT_mobilic-api&issues=AYyMCM-NLDc9JXTddumE&open=AYyMCM-NLDc9JXTddumE\">SonarQube Cloud</a></p>"},"location":{"path":"app/helpers/france_connect.py","start_line":50,"end_line":50,"start_column":49,"end_column":76},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/code-scanning/alerts/17/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":16,"created_at":"2023-12-21T11:00:39Z","updated_at":"2023-12-21T11:00:41Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/code-scanning/alerts/16","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/security/code-scanning/16","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"python:S6786","severity":"warning","description":"GraphQL introspection should be disabled in production","name":"python:S6786","tags":["cwe","graphql"],"full_description":"GraphQL introspection should be disabled in production","help":"<p>This vulnerability exposes information about all the APIs available on a GraphQL API server.
