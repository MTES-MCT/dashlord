messages and stack traces, to an external user can expose implementation details that are useful to an attacker for developing a subsequent exploit.","help":"# Information exposure through an exception\nSoftware developers often add stack traces to error messages, as a debugging aid. Whenever that error message occurs for an end user, the developer can use the stack trace to help identify how to fix the problem. In particular, stack traces can tell the developer more about the sequence of events that led to a failure, as opposed to merely the final state of the software when the error occurred.\n\nUnfortunately, the same information can be useful to an attacker. The sequence of class names in a stack trace can reveal the structure of the application as well as any internal components it relies on. Furthermore, the error message at the top of a stack trace can include information such as server-side file names and SQL code that the application relies on, allowing an attacker to fine-tune a subsequent injection attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nSend the user a more generic error message that reveals less information. Either suppress the stack trace entirely, or log it only on the server.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an exception is handled in two different ways. In the first version, labeled BAD, the exception is sent back to the remote user by returning it from the function. As such, the user is able to see a detailed stack trace, which may contain sensitive information. In the second version, the error message is logged only on the server, and a generic error message is displayed to the user. That way, the developers can still access and use the error log, but remote users will not see the information.\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n\nimport traceback\n\ndef do_computation():\n    raise Exception(\"Secret info\")\n\n# BAD\n@app.route('/bad')\ndef server_bad():\n    try:\n        do_computation()\n    except Exception as e:\n        return traceback.format_exc()\n\n# GOOD\n@app.route('/good')\ndef server_good():\n    try:\n        do_computation()\n    except Exception as e:\n        log(traceback.format_exc())\n        return \"An internal error has occurred!\"\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Improper Error Handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-209](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-497](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/497.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.22.0"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:python\",\"language\":\"python\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:python","state":"open","commit_sha":"9c6604f45c8d6237a69701e6561dd7cfa0600fa6","message":{"text":"Stack trace information flows to this location and may be exposed to an external user."},"location":{"path":"app/controllers/company.py","start_line":746,"end_line":746,"start_column":42,"end_column":59},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/code-scanning/alerts/107/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":104,"created_at":"2024-10-10T07:05:40Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T07:05:42Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/code-scanning/alerts/104","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/security/code-scanning/104","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"py/url-redirection","severity":"error","description":"URL redirection from remote source","name":"py/url-redirection","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-601","security"],"full_description":"URL redirection based on unvalidated user input may cause redirection to malicious web sites.","help":"# URL redirection from remote source\nDirectly incorporating user input into a URL redirect request without validating the input can facilitate phishing attacks. In these attacks, unsuspecting users can be redirected to a malicious site that looks very similar to the real site they intend to visit, but which is controlled by the attacker.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against untrusted URL redirection, it is advisable to avoid putting user input directly into a redirect URL. Instead, maintain a list of authorized redirects on the server; then choose from that list based on the user input provided.\n\nIf this is not possible, then the user input should be validated in some other way, for example, by verifying that the target URL does not include an explicit host name.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in a URL redirect without validating the input, which facilitates phishing attacks:\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    return redirect(target, code=302)\n\n```\nIf you know the set of valid redirect targets, you can maintain a list of them on the server and check that the user input is in that list:\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\n\nVALID_REDIRECT = \"http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html\"\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    if target == VALID_REDIRECT:\n        return redirect(target, code=302)\n    else:\n        # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n        return redirect('/', code=302)\n\n```\nOften this is not possible, so an alternative is to check that the target URL does not specify an explicit host name. For example, you can use the `urlparse` function from the Python standard library to parse the URL and check that the `netloc` attribute is empty.\n\nNote, however, that some cases are not handled as we desire out-of-the-box by `urlparse`, so we need to adjust two things, as shown in the example below:\n\n* Many browsers accept backslash characters (`\\`) as equivalent to forward slash characters (`/`) in URLs, but the `urlparse` function does not.\n* Mistyped URLs such as `https:/example.com` or `https:///example.com` are parsed as having an empty `netloc` attribute, while browsers will still redirect to the correct site.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    target = target.replace('\\\\', '')\n    if not urlparse(target).netloc and not urlparse(target).scheme:\n        # relative path, safe to redirect\n        return redirect(target, code=302)\n    # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n    return redirect('/', code=302)\n\n```\nFor Django application, you can use the function `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme` to check that a URL is safe to redirect to, as shown in the following example:\n\n\n```python\nfrom django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\nfrom django.shortcuts import redirect\nfrom django.utils.http import url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme\nfrom django.views import View\n\nclass RedirectView(View):\n    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n        target = request.GET.get('target', '')\n        if url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme(target, allowed_hosts=None):\n            return HttpResponseRedirect(target)\n        else:\n            # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n            return redirect('/')\n```\nNote that `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme` handles backslashes correctly, so no additional processing is required.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [ XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Python standard library: [ urllib.parse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.22.0"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:python\",\"language\":\"python\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:python","state":"open","commit_sha":"9c6604f45c8d6237a69701e6561dd7cfa0600fa6","message":{"text":"Untrusted URL redirection depends on a user-provided value."},"location":{"path":"app/controllers/controller.py","start_line":95,"end_line":95,"start_column":9,"end_column":123},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/code-scanning/alerts/104/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":103,"created_at":"2024-10-10T07:05:40Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T07:05:42Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/code-scanning/alerts/103","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/security/code-scanning/103","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"py/url-redirection","severity":"error","description":"URL redirection from remote source","name":"py/url-redirection","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-601","security"],"full_description":"URL redirection based on unvalidated user input may cause redirection to malicious web sites.","help":"# URL redirection from remote source\nDirectly incorporating user input into a URL redirect request without validating the input can facilitate phishing attacks.

This\nvulnerability class allows malicious actors to craft fraudulent tokens, effectively impersonating user identities. In essence, the integrity of a JWT\nhinges on the strength and presence of its signature.</p>\n<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>\n<p>When a JSON Web Token is not appropriately signed with a strong cipher algorithm or if the signature is not verified, it becomes a significant\nthreat to data security and the privacy of user identities.</p>\n<h4>Impersonation of users</h4>\n<p>JWTs are commonly used to represent user authorization claims. They contain information about the user’s identity, user roles, and access rights.\nWhen these tokens are not securely signed, it allows an attacker to forge them. In essence, a weak or missing signature gives an attacker the power to\ncraft a token that could impersonate any user. For instance, they could create a token for an administrator account, gaining access to high-level\npermissions and sensitive data.</p>\n<h4>Unauthorized data access</h4>\n<p>When a JWT is not securely signed, it can be tampered with by an attacker, and the integrity of the data it carries cannot be trusted. An attacker\ncan manipulate the content of the token and grant themselves permissions they should not have, leading to unauthorized data access.</p>\n<h2>How to fix it in PyJWT</h2>\n<h3>Code examples</h3>\n<p>The following code contains an example of JWT decoding without verification of the signature.</p>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nimport jwt\n\njwt.decode(token, options={\"verify_signature\":False}) # Noncompliant\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<p>By default, verification is enabled for the method <code>decode</code>.</p>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nimport jwt\n\njwt.decode(token, key, algorithms=\"HS256\")\n</pre>\n<h3>How does this work?</h3>\n<h4>Verify the signature of your tokens</h4>\n<p>Resolving a vulnerability concerning the validation of JWT token signatures is mainly about incorporating a critical step into your process:\nvalidating the signature every time a token is decoded. Just having a signed token using a secure algorithm is not enough. If you are not validating\nsignatures, they are not serving their purpose.</p>\n<p>Every time your application receives a JWT, it needs to decode the token to extract the information contained within. It is during this decoding\nprocess that the signature of the JWT should also be checked.</p>\n<p>To resolve the issue, follow these instructions:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li> Use framework-specific functions for signature verification: Most programming frameworks that support JWTs provide specific functions to not\n  only decode a token but also validate its signature simultaneously. Make sure to use these functions when handling incoming tokens. </li>\n  <li> Handle invalid signatures appropriately: If a JWT’s signature does not validate correctly, it means the token is not trustworthy, indicating\n  potential tampering. The action to take when encountering an invalid token should be denying the request carrying it and logging the event for\n  further investigation. </li>\n  <li> Incorporate signature validation in your tests: When you are writing tests for your application, include tests that check the signature\n  validation functionality. This can help you catch any instances where signature verification might be unintentionally skipped or bypassed. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>By following these practices, you can ensure the security of your application’s JWT handling process, making it resistant to attacks that rely on\ntampering with tokens. Validation of the signature needs to be an integral and non-negotiable part of your token handling process.</p>\n<h3>Going the extra mile</h3>\n<h4>Securely store your secret keys</h4>\n<p>Ensure that your secret keys are stored securely. They should not be hard-coded into your application code or checked into your version control\nsystem. Instead, consider using environment variables, secure key management systems, or vault services.</p>\n<h4>Rotate your secret keys</h4>\n<p>Even with the strongest cipher algorithms, there is a risk that your secret keys may be compromised. Therefore, it is a good practice to\nperiodically rotate your secret keys. By doing so, you limit the amount of time that an attacker can misuse a stolen key. When you rotate keys, be\nsure to allow a grace period where tokens signed with the old key are still accepted to prevent service disruptions.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<h3>Standards</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/\">Top 10 2021 Category A2 - Cryptographic Failures</a> </li>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure\">Top 10 2017 Category A3 - Sensitive Data\n  Exposure</a> </li>\n  <li> CWE - <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/347\">CWE-347 - Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature</a> </li>\n</ul>","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"SonarCloud","guid":null,"version":null},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"(default)","environment":"{}","category":"","state":"open","commit_sha":"9c6604f45c8d6237a69701e6561dd7cfa0600fa6","message":{"text":"<!--SONAR_ISSUE_KEY:AYyMCM-NLDc9JXTddumE-->Don't use a JWT token without verifying its signature. <p>See more on <a href=\"https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=MTES-MCT_mobilic-api&issues=AYyMCM-NLDc9JXTddumE&open=AYyMCM-NLDc9JXTddumE\">SonarQube Cloud</a></p>"},"location":{"path":"app/helpers/france_connect.py","start_line":50,"end_line":50,"start_column":49,"end_column":76},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/code-scanning/alerts/17/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":16,"created_at":"2023-12-21T11:00:39Z","updated_at":"2023-12-21T11:00:41Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/code-scanning/alerts/16","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/mobilic-api/security/code-scanning/16","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"python:S6786","severity":"warning","description":"GraphQL introspection should be disabled in production","name":"python:S6786","tags":["cwe","graphql"],"full_description":"GraphQL introspection should be disabled in production","help":"<p>This vulnerability exposes information about all the APIs available on a GraphQL API server.

Considering the source\ncode is intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get\nexposed to an unintended audience.</p>\n<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>\n<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.\nUnintended people who don’t need to know the secret might get access to it. They might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated\nservices or resources.</p>\n<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people’s role and entitlement.</p>\n<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>\n<p>Passwords in PostgreSQL are used to authenticate users against the database engine. They are associated with user accounts that are granted\nspecific permissions over the database and its hosted data.</p>\n<p>If a PostgreSQL password leaks to an unintended audience, it can have serious consequences for the security of your database, the data stored\nwithin it, and the applications that rely on it.</p>\n<h4>Compromise of sensitive data</h4>\n<p>If the affected service is used to store or process personally identifiable information or other sensitive data, attackers knowing an\nauthentication secret could be able to access it. Depending on the type of data that is compromised, it could lead to privacy violations, identity\ntheft, financial loss, or other negative outcomes.</p>\n<p>In most cases, a company suffering a sensitive data compromise will face a reputational loss when the security issue is publicly disclosed.</p>\n<h4>Security downgrade</h4>\n<p>Applications relying on a PostgreSQL database instance can suffer a security downgrade if an access password is leaked to attackers. Depending on\nthe purposes the application uses the database for, consequences can range from low-severity issues, like defacement, to complete compromise.</p>\n<p>For example, if the PostgreSQL instance is used as part of the authentication process of an application, attackers with access to the database will\nlikely be able to bypass this security mechanism.</p>\n<h2>How to fix it</h2>\n<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>\n<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>\n<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the\nsecret is revoked.</p>\n<p><strong>Analyze recent secret use</strong></p>\n<p>When available, analyze authentication logs to identify any unintended or malicious use of the secret since its disclosure date. Doing this will\nallow determining if an attacker took advantage of the leaked secret and to what extent.</p>\n<p>This operation should be part of a global incident response process.</p>\n<p>By default, no connection information is logged by PostgreSQL server. The <code>log_connections</code> parameter must be set to <code>true</code>\nin the server configuration for this to happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>\n<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This will ensure the secret’s security and prevent any further unexpected\ndisclosure.</p>\n<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple solutions are currently available.</p>\n<p><strong>Never hard-code secrets, not even the default values</strong></p>\n<p>It is important that you do not hard-code secrets, even default values.</p>\n<p>First, hard-coded default secrets are often short and can be easily compromised even by attackers who do not have access to the code base.</p>\n<p>Second, hard-coded default secrets can cause problems if they need to be changed or replaced.</p>\n<p>And most importantly, there is always the possibility to accidentally set default secrets for production services, which can lead to security\nvulnerabilities and make production insecure by default.</p>\n<p>To minimize these risks, it is recommended to apply the above strategies, even for the default settings.</p>\n<h3>Code examples</h3>\n<h4>Noncompliant code
