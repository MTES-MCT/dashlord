Using text from the DOM as HTML effectively unescapes the text, and thereby invalidates any escaping done on the text. If an attacker is able to control the safe sanitized text, then this vulnerability can be exploited to perform a cross-site scripting attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing text to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the References section below.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a webpage using a `data-target` attribute to select and manipulate a DOM element using the JQuery library. In the example, the `data-target` attribute is read into the `target` variable, and the `$` function is then supposed to use the `target` variable as a CSS selector to determine which element should be manipulated.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n    $(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\nHowever, if an attacker can control the `data-target` attribute, then the value of `target` can be used to cause the `$` function to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThe above vulnerability can be fixed by using `$.find` instead of `$`. The `$.find` function will only interpret `target` as a CSS selector and never as HTML, thereby preventing an XSS attack.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n\t$.find(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP [DOM Based XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS).\n* OWASP [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.21.2"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:upload","environment":"{}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"05f11751550aa136d78db7e4dbf971fb4f80c730","message":{"text":"DOM text is reinterpreted as HTML without escaping meta-characters."},"location":{"path":"envergo/templates/admin/choice_filter.html","start_line":5,"end_line":5,"start_column":37,"end_column":47},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/3/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":2,"created_at":"2022-09-30T08:30:14Z","updated_at":"2023-05-15T08:40:14Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/2","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/envergo/security/code-scanning/2","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"pythonsecurity:S5145","severity":"warning","description":"Logging should not be vulnerable to injection attacks","name":"pythonsecurity:S5145","tags":["cwe"],"full_description":"Logging should not be vulnerable to injection attacks","help":"<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>\n<p>Log injection occurs when an application fails to sanitize untrusted data used for logging.</p>\n<p>An attacker can forge log content to prevent an organization from being able to trace back malicious activities.</p>\n<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>\n<p>If an attacker can insert arbitrary data into a log file, the integrity of the chain of events being recorded can be compromised.<br> This\nfrequently occurs because attackers can inject the log entry separator of the logger framework, commonly newlines, and thus insert artificial log\nentries. <br> Other attacks could also occur requiring only field pollution, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or code injection (for example,\nLog4Shell) if the logged data is fed to other application components, which may interpret the injected data differently.<br></p>\n<p>The focus of this rule is newline character replacement.</p>\n<h4>Log Forge</h4>\n<p>An attacker, able to create independent log entries by injecting log entry separators, inserts bogus data into a log file to conceal his malicious\nactivities. This obscures the content for an incident response team to trace the origin of the breach as the indicators of compromise (IoCs) lead to\nfake application events.</p>\n<h2>How to fix it in Flask</h2>\n<h3>Code examples</h3>\n<p>The following code is vulnerable to log injection as it constructs log entries using untrusted data.

However, further actions could be required based on\nthe application context and the logged data usage.</p>\n<p>Here, the example compliant code uses the <code>isalnum</code> function to ensure the untrusted data is safe.
