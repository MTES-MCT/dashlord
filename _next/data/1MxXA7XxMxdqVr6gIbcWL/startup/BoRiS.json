If a malicious user provides \\`username=Guest%0a\\[INFO\\]+User:+Admin%0a\\` as a username parameter, the log entry will be splitted in two different lines, where the second line will be \\`\\[INFO\\]+User:+Admin\\`.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst url = require('url');\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n    let q = url.parse(req.url, true);\n\n    console.info(`[INFO] User: ${q.query.username}`); // BAD: User input logged as-is\n})\n\nserver.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {});\n\n```\nIn the second example, `String.prototype.replace` is used to ensure no line endings are present in the user input.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst url = require('url');\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n    let q = url.parse(req.url, true);\n\n    // GOOD: remove newlines from user controlled input before logging\n    let username = q.query.username.replace(/\\n|\\r/g, \"\");\n\n    console.info(`[INFO] User: ${username}`);\n});\n\nserver.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Log
