It may, for example, be used for:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Model initialization\n    <ul>\n      <li> Randomness is used to initialize the parameters of machine learning models. Initializing parameters with random values helps to break\n      symmetry and prevents models from getting stuck in local optima during training. By providing a random starting point, the model can explore\n      different regions of the parameter space and potentially find better solutions. </li>\n    </ul>  </li>\n  <li> Regularization techniques\n    <ul>\n      <li> Randomness is used to introduce noise into the learning process. Techniques like dropout and data augmentation use random numbers to\n      randomly drop or modify features or samples during training. This helps to regularize the model, reduce overfitting, and improve generalization\n      performance. </li>\n    </ul>  </li>\n  <li> Cross-validation and bootstrapping\n    <ul>\n      <li> Randomness is often used in techniques like cross-validation, where data is split into multiple subsets. By using a predictable seed, the\n      same data splits can be generated, allowing for fair and consistent model evaluation. </li>\n    </ul>  </li>\n  <li> Hyperparameter tuning\n    <ul>\n      <li> Many machine learning algorithms have hyperparameters that need to be tuned for optimal performance. Randomness is often used in techniques\n      like random search or Bayesian optimization to explore the hyperparameter space. By using a fixed seed, the same set of hyperparameters can be\n      explored, making the tuning process more controlled and reproducible. </li>\n    </ul>  </li>\n  <li> Simulation and synthetic data generation\n    <ul>\n      <li> Randomness is often used in techniques such as data augmentation and synthetic data generation to generate diverse and realistic datasets.\n      </li>\n    </ul>  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>To ensure that results are reproducible, it is important to use a predictable seed in this context.</p>\n<p>The preferred way to do this in <code>numpy</code> is by instantiating a <code>Generator</code> object, typically through\n<code>numpy.random.default_rng</code>, which should be provided with a seed parameter.</p>\n<p>Note that a global seed for <code>RandomState</code> can be set using <code>numpy.random.seed</code> or <code>numpy.seed</code>, this will set the\nseed for <code>RandomState</code> methods such as <code>numpy.random.randn</code>. This approach is, however, deprecated and <code>Generator</code>\nshould be used instead. This is reported by rule {rule:python:S6711}.</p>\n<h3>Exception</h3>\n<p>In contexts that are not related to data science and machine learning, having a predictable seed may not be the desired behavior.

Usually, this is done by escaping meta-characters such as quotes in a domain-specific way so that they are treated as normal characters.\n\nHowever, directly using the string `replace` method to perform escaping is notoriously error-prone. Common mistakes include only replacing the first occurrence of a meta-character, or backslash-escaping various meta-characters but not the backslash itself.\n\nIn the former case, later meta-characters are left undisturbed and can be used to subvert the sanitization. In the latter case, preceding a meta-character with a backslash leads to the backslash being escaped, but the meta-character appearing un-escaped, which again makes the sanitization ineffective.\n\nEven if the escaped string is not used in a security-critical context, incomplete escaping may still have undesirable effects, such as badly rendered or confusing output.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a (well-tested) sanitization library if at all possible. These libraries are much more likely to handle corner cases correctly than a custom implementation.\n\nAn even safer alternative is to design the application so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using prepared statements for SQL queries.\n\nOtherwise, make sure to use a regular expression with the `g` flag to ensure that all occurrences are replaced, and remember to escape backslashes if applicable.\n\n\n## Example\nFor example, assume that we want to embed a user-controlled string `accountNumber` into a SQL query as part of a string literal. To avoid SQL injection, we need to ensure that the string does not contain un-escaped single-quote characters. The following function attempts to ensure this by doubling single quotes, and thereby escaping them:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(\"'\", \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nAs written, this sanitizer is ineffective: if the first argument to `replace` is a string literal (as in this case), only the *first* occurrence of that string is replaced.\n\nAs mentioned above, the function `escapeQuotes` should be replaced with a purpose-built sanitization library, such as the npm module `sqlstring`. Many other sanitization libraries are available from npm and other sources.\n\nIf this is not an option, `escapeQuotes` should be rewritten to use a regular expression with the `g` (\"global\") flag instead:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(/'/g, \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nNote that it is very important to include the global flag: `s.replace(/'/, \"''\")` *without* the global flag is equivalent to the first example above and only replaces the first quote.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP Top 10: [A1 Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection).\n* npm: [sqlstring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlstring) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-80](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.23.0"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/master","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"427fa4feab6d238cd93cb3c641148d8dfafbab2c","message":{"text":"This replaces only the first occurrence of \"\\n\"."},"location":{"path":"front/src/lot-add/components/lot-form.tsx","start_line":306,"end_line":306,"start_column":15,"end_column":39},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/carbure/code-scanning/alerts/66/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":65,"created_at":"2024-10-10T07:12:48Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T07:12:50Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/carbure/code-scanning/alerts/65","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/carbure/security/code-scanning/65","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/xss-through-dom","severity":"warning","description":"DOM text reinterpreted as HTML","name":"js/xss-through-dom","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-079","external/cwe/cwe-116","security"],"full_description":"Reinterpreting text from the DOM as HTML can lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.","help":"# DOM text reinterpreted as HTML\nExtracting text from a DOM node and interpreting it as HTML can lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.\n\nA webpage with this vulnerability reads text from the DOM, and afterwards adds the text as HTML to the DOM.
