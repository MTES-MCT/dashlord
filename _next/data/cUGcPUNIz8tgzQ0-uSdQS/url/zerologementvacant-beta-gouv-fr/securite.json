this an issue?</h2>\n<p>GitHub Actions workflows can access various sources of untrusted data through the GitHub context, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Pull request titles, descriptions, and commit messages </li>\n  <li> Issue titles and comments </li>\n  <li> Branch names and tag names </li>\n  <li> User-provided inputs </li>\n</ul>\n<p>When this untrusted data is directly interpolated into

For example, when a program that expects an array is passed a JSON object such as `{length: 1e100}`, the loop will be run for 10<sup>100</sup> iterations. This may cause the program to hang or run out of memory, which can be used to mount a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEither check that the object is indeed an array or limit the size of the `.length` property.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the example below, an HTTP request handler iterates over a user-controlled object `obj` using the `obj.length` property in order to copy the elements from `obj` to an array.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\napp.post(\"/foo\", (req, res) => {\n    var obj = req.body;\n\n    var ret = [];\n\n    // Potential DoS if obj.length is large.\n    for (var i = 0; i < obj.length; i++) {\n        ret.push(obj[i]);\n    }\n});\n\n```\nThis is not secure since an attacker can control the value of `obj.length`, and thereby cause the loop to iterate indefinitely. Here the potential DoS is fixed by enforcing that the user-controlled object is an array.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\napp.post(\"/foo\", (req, res) => {\n    var obj = req.body;\n    \n    if (!(obj instanceof Array)) { // Prevents DoS.\n        return [];\n    }\n\n    var ret = [];\n\n    for (var i = 0; i < obj.length; i++) {\n        ret.push(obj[i]);\n    }\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-834](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/834.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.23.2"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":".github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml:analyze","environment":"{\"language\":\"typescript\"}","category":".github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml:analyze/language:typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"5713d32c52c2f23b044419dae4abbe2eb9d7221a","message":{"text":"Iteration over a user-controlled object with a potentially unbounded .length property from a user-provided value."},"location":{"path":"packages/draft/src/pdf.ts","start_line":460,"end_line":460,"start_column":29,"end_column":39},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/zero-logement-vacant/code-scanning/alerts/289/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":288,"created_at":"2025-07-22T13:48:17Z","updated_at":"2025-07-30T13:17:52Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/zero-logement-vacant/code-scanning/alerts/288","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/zero-logement-vacant/security/code-scanning/288","assignees":[],"state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/insecure-randomness","severity":"warning","description":"Insecure randomness","name":"js/insecure-randomness","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-338","security"],"full_description":"Using a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator to generate a security-sensitive value may allow an attacker to predict what value will be generated.","help":"# Insecure randomness\nUsing a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator to generate a security-sensitive value, such as a password, makes it easier for an attacker to predict the value.\n\nPseudo-random number generators generate a sequence of numbers that only approximates the properties of random numbers. The sequence is not truly random because it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values, the seed. If the random number generator is cryptographically weak, then this sequence may be easily predictable through outside observations.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator if the output is to be used in a security-sensitive context. As a rule of thumb, a value should be considered \"security-sensitive\" if predicting it would allow the attacker to perform an action that they would otherwise be unable to perform. For example, if an attacker could predict the random password generated for a new user, they would be able to log in as that new user.\n\nFor JavaScript on the NodeJS platform, `crypto.getRandomBytes` provides a cryptographically secure pseudo-random byte generator. Note that the conversion from bytes to numbers can introduce bias that breaks the security.\n\nFor JavaScript in the browser, `crypto.getRandomValues` provides a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following examples show different ways of generating a password.\n\nIn the first case, we generate a fresh password by appending a random integer to the end of a static string. The random number generator used (`Math.random`) is not cryptographically secure, so it may be possible for an attacker to predict the generated password.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction insecurePassword() {\n    // BAD: the random suffix is not cryptographically secure\n    var suffix = Math.random();\n    var password = \"myPassword\" + suffix;\n    return password;\n}\n\n```\nIn the second example, a cryptographically secure random number generator is used for the same purpose. In this case, it is much harder to predict the generated integers.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction securePassword() {\n    // GOOD: the random suffix is cryptographically secure\n    var suffix = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(1))[0];\n    var password = \"myPassword\" + suffix;\n    \n    // GOOD: if a random value between 0 and 1 is desired\n    var secret = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(1))[0] * Math.pow(2,-32);\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [Pseudo-random number generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator).\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [Crypto: getRandomValues()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/getRandomValues).\n* NodeJS: [crypto.randomBytes](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_randombytes_size_callback)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-338](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html).\n","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.23.2"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":".github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml:analyze","environment":"{\"language\":\"typescript\"}","category":".github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml:analyze/language:typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"5713d32c52c2f23b044419dae4abbe2eb9d7221a","message":{"text":"This uses a cryptographically insecure random number generated at Math.random() in a security context."},"location":{"path":"frontend/test/fixtures.ts","start_line":165,"end_line":165,"start_column":17,"end_column":29},"classifications":["test"]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/zero-logement-vacant/code-scanning/alerts/288/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":98,"created_at":"2025-03-19T15:07:34Z","updated_at":"2025-03-19T15:07:35Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/zero-logement-vacant/code-scanning/alerts/98","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/zero-logement-vacant/security/code-scanning/98","assignees":[],"state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"docker:S6437","severity":"warning","description":"Credentials should not be hard-coded","name":"docker:S6437","tags":["cwe"],"full_description":"Credentials should not be hard-coded","help":"<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source\ncode is intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get\nexposed to an unintended audience.</p>\n<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>\n<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.\nUnintended people who don’t need to know the secret might get access to it. They might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated\nservices or resources.</p>\n<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people’s role and entitlement.</p>\n<p>In Dockerfiles, hard-coded secrets and secrets passed through as variables or created at build-time will cause security risks. The secret\ninformation can be exposed either via the container environment, the image metadata, or the build environment logs.</p>\n<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>\n<p>The consequences vary greatly depending on the situation and the secret-exposed audience. Still, two main scenarios should be considered.</p>\n<h4>Financial loss</h4>\n<p>Financial losses can occur when a secret is used to access a paid third-party-provided service and is disclosed as part of the source code of\nclient applications. Having the secret, each user of the application will be able to use it without limit to use the third party service to their own\nneed, including in a way that was not expected.</p>\n<p>This additional use of the secret will lead to added costs with the service provider.</p>\n<p>Moreover, when rate or volume limiting is set up on the provider side, this additional use can prevent the regular operation of the affected\napplication. This might result in a partial denial of service for all the application’s users.</p>\n<h4>Application’s security downgrade</h4>\n<p>A downgrade can happen when the disclosed secret is used to protect security-sensitive assets or features of the application. Depending on the\naffected asset or feature, the practical impact can range from a sensitive information leak to a complete takeover of the application, its hosting\nserver or another linked component.</p>\n<p>For example, an application that would disclose a secret used to sign user authentication tokens would be at risk of user identity impersonation.\nAn attacker accessing the leaked secret could sign session tokens for arbitrary users and take over their privileges and entitlements.</p>\n<h3>Exceptions</h3>\n<p>In multi-stage builds, the rule only scans instructions that are part of the final image.</p>\n<h2>How to fix it</h2>\n<p>Best practices recommend using a secret vault for all secrets that must be accessed at container runtime. This will ensure the secret’s security\nand prevent any further unexpected disclosure. Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple solutions are currently\navailable.</p>\n<p>For all secrets that must be accessed at image build time, it is recommended to rely on Docker Buildkit’s secret mount options. This will prevent\nsecrets from being disclosed in image’s metadata and build logs.</p>\n<p>Additionally, investigations and remediation actions should be conducted to ensure the current and future security of the infrastructure.</p>\n<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>\n<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>\n<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes are using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the\nsecret is revoked.</p>\n<p><strong>Analyze recent secret use</strong></p>\n<p>When available, analyze authentication logs to identify any unintended or malicious use of the secret since its disclosure date. Doing this will\nallow determining if an attacker took advantage of the leaked secret and to what extent.</p>\n<p>This operation should be part of a global incident response process.</p>\n<h3>Code examples</h3>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<p>The following code sample generates a new SSH private key that will be stored in the generated image. This key should be considered as compromised.\nMoreover, the SSH key encryption passphrase is also hardcoded.</p>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nFROM example\n\n# Noncompliant\nRUN ssh-keygen -N \"passphrase\" -t rsa -b 2048 -f /etc/ssh/rsa_key\n\nRUN /example.sh --ssh /etc/ssh/rsa_key\n</pre>\n<p>The following code sample uses a seemingly hidden password which is actually leaked in the image metadata after the build.</p>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"2\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nFROM example\nARG PASSWORD\n\n# Noncompliant\nRUN wget --user=guest --password=\"$PASSWORD\" https://example.com\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nFROM example\n\nRUN --mount=type=secret,id=ssh,target=/etc/ssh/rsa_key \\\n    /example.sh --ssh /etc/ssh/rsa_key\n</pre>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"2\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nFROM example\n\nRUN --mount=type=secret,id=wget,target=/home/user/.wgetrc \\\n    wget --user=guest https://example.com\n</pre>\n<p>For runtime secrets, best practices recommend relying on a vault service to pass secret information to the containers.
