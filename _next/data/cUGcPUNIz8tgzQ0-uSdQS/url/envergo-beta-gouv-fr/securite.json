redirection from remote source","name":"py/url-redirection","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-601","security"],"full_description":"URL redirection based on unvalidated user input may cause redirection to malicious web sites.","help":"# URL redirection from remote source\nDirectly incorporating user input into a URL redirect request without validating the input can facilitate phishing attacks. In these attacks, unsuspecting users can be redirected to a malicious site that looks very similar to the real site they intend to visit, but which is controlled by the attacker.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against untrusted URL redirection, it is advisable to avoid putting user input directly into a redirect URL. Instead, maintain a list of authorized redirects on the server; then choose from that list based on the user input provided.\n\nIf this is not possible, then the user input should be validated in some other way, for example, by verifying that the target URL does not include an explicit host name.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in a URL redirect without validating the input, which facilitates phishing attacks:\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    return redirect(target, code=302)\n\n```\nIf you know the set of valid redirect targets, you can maintain a list of them on the server and check that the user input is in that list:\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\n\nVALID_REDIRECT = \"http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html\"\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    if target == VALID_REDIRECT:\n        return redirect(target, code=302)\n    else:\n        # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n        return redirect('/', code=302)\n\n```\nOften this is not possible, so an alternative is to check that the target URL does not specify an explicit host name. For example, you can use the `urlparse` function from the Python standard library to parse the URL and check that the `netloc` attribute is empty.\n\nNote, however, that some cases are not handled as we desire out-of-the-box by `urlparse`, so we need to adjust two things, as shown in the example below:\n\n* Many browsers accept backslash characters (`\\`) as equivalent to forward slash characters (`/`) in URLs, but the `urlparse` function does not.\n* Mistyped URLs such as `https:/example.com` or `https:///example.com` are parsed as having an empty `netloc` attribute, while browsers will still redirect to the correct site.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    target = target.replace('\\\\', '')\n    if not urlparse(target).netloc and not urlparse(target).scheme:\n        # relative path, safe to redirect\n        return redirect(target, code=302)\n    # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n    return redirect('/', code=302)\n\n```\nFor Django application, you can use the function `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme` to check that a URL is safe to redirect to, as shown in the following example:\n\n\n```python\nfrom django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\nfrom django.shortcuts import redirect\nfrom django.utils.http import url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme\nfrom django.views import View\n\nclass RedirectView(View):\n    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n        target = request.GET.get('target', '')\n        if url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme(target, allowed_hosts=None):\n            return HttpResponseRedirect(target)\n        else:\n            # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n            return redirect('/')\n```\nNote that `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme` handles backslashes correctly, so no additional processing is required.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [ XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Python standard library: [ urllib.parse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.23.2"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:python\",\"language\":\"python\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:python","state":"open","commit_sha":"6c6f08e9d858dfbd5f18cbf72a8ccf4218eee45e","message":{"text":"Untrusted URL redirection depends on a user-provided value."},"location":{"path":"envergo/petitions/views.py","start_line":1284,"end_line":1284,"start_column":21,"end_column":29},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/21/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":13,"created_at":"2025-03-27T14:12:20Z","updated_at":"2025-04-07T08:39:08Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/13","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/envergo/security/code-scanning/13","assignees":[],"state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"py/stack-trace-exposure","severity":"error","description":"Information exposure through an exception","name":"py/stack-trace-exposure","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-209","external/cwe/cwe-497","security"],"full_description":"Leaking information about an exception, such as messages and stack traces, to an external user can expose implementation details that are useful to an attacker for developing a subsequent exploit.","help":"# Information exposure through an exception\nSoftware developers often add stack traces to error messages, as a debugging aid.

Using text from the DOM as HTML effectively unescapes the text, and thereby invalidates any escaping done on the text. If an attacker is able to control the safe sanitized text, then this vulnerability can be exploited to perform a cross-site scripting attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing text to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the References section below.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a webpage using a `data-target` attribute to select and manipulate a DOM element using the JQuery library. In the example, the `data-target` attribute is read into the `target` variable, and the `$` function is then supposed to use the `target` variable as a CSS selector to determine which element should be manipulated.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n    $(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\nHowever, if an attacker can control the `data-target` attribute, then the value of `target` can be used to cause the `$` function to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThe above vulnerability can be fixed by using `$.find` instead of `$`. The `$.find` function will only interpret `target` as a CSS selector and never as HTML, thereby preventing an XSS attack.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n\t$.find(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP [DOM Based XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS).\n* OWASP [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.23.2"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"6c6f08e9d858dfbd5f18cbf72a8ccf4218eee45e","message":{"text":"DOM text is reinterpreted as HTML without escaping meta-characters."},"location":{"path":"envergo/templates/admin/choice_filter.html","start_line":5,"end_line":5,"start_column":37,"end_column":47},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/3/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":2,"created_at":"2022-09-30T08:30:14Z","updated_at":"2023-05-15T08:40:14Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/2","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/envergo/security/code-scanning/2","assignees":[],"state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"pythonsecurity:S5145","severity":"warning","description":"Logging should not be vulnerable to injection attacks","name":"pythonsecurity:S5145","tags":["cwe"],"full_description":"Logging should not be vulnerable to injection attacks","help":"<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>\n<p>Log injection occurs when an application fails to sanitize untrusted data used for logging.</p>\n<p>An attacker can forge log content to prevent an organization from being able to trace back malicious activities.</p>\n<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>\n<p>If an attacker can insert arbitrary data into a log file, the integrity of the chain of events being recorded can be compromised.<br> This\nfrequently occurs because attackers can inject the log entry separator of the logger framework, commonly newlines, and thus insert artificial log\nentries. <br> Other attacks could also occur requiring only field pollution, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or code injection (for example,\nLog4Shell) if the logged data is fed to other application components, which may interpret the injected data differently.<br></p>\n<p>The focus of this rule is newline character replacement.</p>\n<h4>Log Forge</h4>\n<p>An attacker, able to create independent log entries by injecting log entry separators, inserts bogus data into a log file to conceal his malicious\nactivities. This obscures the content for an incident response team to trace the origin of the breach as the indicators of compromise (IoCs) lead to\nfake application events.</p>\n<h2>How to fix it in Flask</h2>\n<h3>Code examples</h3>\n<p>The following code is vulnerable to log injection as it constructs log entries using untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this to manipulate\nthe chain of events being recorded.</p>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nimport logging\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/example')\ndef log():\n    data = request.args[\"data\"]\n    app.logger.critical(\"%s\", data) # Noncompliant\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nimport logging\nimport base64\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/example')\ndef log():\n    data = request.args[\"data\"]\n    if data.isalnum():\n        app.logger.critical(\"%s\", data)\n    else:\n        app.logger.critical(\"Invalid Input: %s\", base64.b64encode(data.encode('UTF-8')))\n</pre>\n<h3>How does this work?</h3>\n<p>Data used for logging should be content-restricted and typed. This can be done by validating the data content or sanitizing it.<br> Validation and\nsanitization mainly revolve around preventing carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) characters. However, further actions could be required based on\nthe application context and the logged data usage.</p>\n<p>Here, the example compliant code uses the <code>isalnum</code> function to ensure the untrusted data is safe. If not, it performs Base64 encoding\nto protect from log injection.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<h3>Standards</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/\">OWASP Top 10 2021
