Instead, use an explicit whitelist of allowed hosts to make the redirect secure:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {\n    let url = req.param('url'),\n        host = urlLib.parse(url).host;\n    // GOOD: the host of `url` can not be controlled by an attacker\n    let allowedHosts = [\n        'example.com',\n        'beta.example.com',\n        'www.example.com'\n    ];\n    if (allowedHosts.includes(host)) {\n        res.redirect(url);\n    }\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [SSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server_Side_Request_Forgery)\n* OWASP: [XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.5"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-22.04\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"23648bbf5ecdd4f14fb1e70223ff618368597b05","message":{"text":"'https://docurba.beta.gouv.fr' may be followed by an arbitrary host name."},"location":{"path":"nuxt/plugins/pdfMake.js","start_line":277,"end_line":277,"start_column":25,"end_column":85},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/52/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":51,"created_at":"2025-02-02T11:32:22Z","updated_at":"2025-02-02T11:34:19Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/51","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/Docurba/security/code-scanning/51","assignees":[],"state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/request-forgery","severity":"error","description":"Server-side request forgery","name":"js/request-forgery","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-918","security"],"full_description":"Making a network request with user-controlled data in the URL allows for request forgery attacks.","help":"# Server-side request forgery\nDirectly incorporating user input in the URL of an outgoing HTTP request can enable a request forgery attack, in which the request is altered to target an unintended API endpoint or resource.

But if an attacker sends multiple request parameters with the same name, then the request parameter is represented as an array instead.\n\nIn the following example, a sanitizer checks that a path does not contain the `\"..\"` string, which would allow an attacker to access content outside a user-accessible directory.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar app = require(\"express\")(),\n  path = require(\"path\");\n\napp.get(\"/user-files\", function(req, res) {\n  var file = req.param(\"file\");\n  if (file.indexOf(\"..\") !== -1) {\n    // BAD\n    // we forbid relative paths that contain ..\n    // as these could leave the public directory\n    res.status(400).send(\"Bad request\");\n  } else {\n    var absolute = path.resolve(\"/public/\" + file);\n    console.log(\"Sending file: %s\", absolute);\n    res.sendFile(absolute);\n  }\n});\n\n```\nAs written, this sanitizer is ineffective: an array like `[\"../\", \"/../secret.txt\"]` will bypass the sanitizer. The array does not contain `\"..\"` as an element, so the call to `indexOf` returns `-1` . This is problematic since the value of the `absolute` variable then ends up being `\"/secret.txt\"`. This happens since the concatenation of `\"/public/\"` and the array results in `\"/public/../,/../secret.txt\"`, which the `resolve`-call converts to `\"/secret.txt\"`.\n\nTo fix the sanitizer, check that the request parameter is a string, and not an array:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar app = require(\"express\")(),\n  path = require(\"path\");\n\napp.get(\"/user-files\", function(req, res) {\n  var file = req.param(\"file\");\n  if (typeof file !== 'string' || file.indexOf(\"..\") !== -1) {\n    // GOOD\n    // we forbid relative paths that contain ..\n    // as these could leave the public directory\n    res.status(400).send(\"Bad request\");\n  } else {\n    var absolute = path.resolve(\"/public/\" + file);\n    console.log(\"Sending file: %s\", absolute);\n    res.sendFile(absolute);\n  }\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Node.js API: [querystring](https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-843](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/843.html).\n","security_severity_level":"critical"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.5"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-22.04\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"23648bbf5ecdd4f14fb1e70223ff618368597b05","message":{"text":"Potential type confusion as this HTTP request parameter may be either an array or a string."},"location":{"path":"nuxt/server-middleware/communes.js","start_line":21,"end_line":21,"start_column":31,"end_column":41},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/46/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":45,"created_at":"2025-02-02T11:32:22Z","updated_at":"2025-02-02T11:34:19Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/45","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/Docurba/security/code-scanning/45","assignees":[],"state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/xss-through-exception","severity":"warning","description":"Exception text reinterpreted as HTML","name":"js/xss-through-exception","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-079","external/cwe/cwe-116","security"],"full_description":"Reinterpreting text from an exception as HTML can lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.","help":"# Exception text reinterpreted as HTML\nDirectly writing error messages to a webpage without sanitization allows for a cross-site scripting vulnerability if parts of the error message can be influenced by a user.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing user input to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the references.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an exception being written directly to the document, and this exception can potentially be influenced by the page URL, leaving the website vulnerable to cross-site scripting.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction setLanguageOptions() {\n    var href = document.location.href,\n        deflt = href.substring(href.indexOf(\"default=\")+8);\n    \n    try {\n        var parsed = unknownParseFunction(deflt); \n    } catch(e) {\n        document.write(\"Had an error: \" + e + \".\");\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## Example\nThis second example shows an input being validated using the JSON schema validator `ajv`, and in case of an error, the error message is sent directly back in the response.\n\n\n```javascript\nimport express from 'express';\nimport Ajv from 'ajv';\n\nlet app = express();\nlet ajv = new Ajv();\n\najv.addSchema({type: 'object', additionalProperties: {type: 'number'}}, 'pollData');\n\napp.post('/polldata', (req, res) => {\n    if (!ajv.validate('pollData', req.body)) {\n        res.send(ajv.errorsText());\n    }\n});\n\n```\nThis is unsafe, because the error message can contain parts of the input.

In these attacks, unsuspecting users can be redirected to a malicious site that looks very similar to the real site they intend to visit, but which is controlled by the attacker.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against untrusted URL redirection, it is advisable to avoid putting user input directly into a redirect URL. Instead, maintain a list of authorized redirects on the server; then choose from that list based on the user input provided.\n\nIf this is not possible, then the user input should be validated in some other way, for example, by verifying that the target URL is on the same host as the current page.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in a URL redirect without validating the input, which facilitates phishing attacks:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\napp.get(\"/redirect\", function (req, res) {\n  // BAD: a request parameter is incorporated without validation into a URL redirect\n  res.redirect(req.query[\"target\"]);\n});\n\n```\nOne way to remedy the problem is to validate the user input against a known fixed string before doing the redirection:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\nconst VALID_REDIRECT = \"http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html\";\n\napp.get(\"/redirect\", function (req, res) {\n  // GOOD: the request parameter is validated against a known fixed string\n  let target = req.query[\"target\"];\n  if (VALID_REDIRECT === target) {\n    res.redirect(target);\n  } else {\n    res.redirect(\"/\");\n  }\n});\n\n```\nAlternatively, we can check that the target URL does not redirect to a different host by parsing it relative to a base URL with a known host and verifying that the host stays the same:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\nfunction isLocalUrl(path) {\n  try {\n    return (\n      // TODO: consider substituting your own domain for example.com\n      new URL(path, \"https://example.com\").origin === \"https://example.com\"\n    );\n  } catch (e) {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n\napp.get(\"/redirect\", function (req, res) {\n  // GOOD: check that we don't redirect to a different host\n  let target = req.query[\"target\"];\n  if (isLocalUrl(target)) {\n    res.redirect(target);\n  } else {\n    res.redirect(\"/\");\n  }\n});\n\n```\nNote that as written, the above code will allow redirects to URLs on `example.com`, which is harmless but perhaps not intended. You can substitute your own domain (if known) for `example.com` to prevent this.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [ XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.5"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-22.04\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"23648bbf5ecdd4f14fb1e70223ff618368597b05","message":{"text":"Untrusted URL redirection depends on a user-provided value."},"location":{"path":"nuxt/server-middleware/redirects.js","start_line":17,"end_line":17,"start_column":23,"end_column":71},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/43/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":42,"created_at":"2025-02-02T11:32:22Z","updated_at":"2025-02-02T11:34:19Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/42","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/Docurba/security/code-scanning/42","assignees":[],"state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/stack-trace-exposure","severity":"warning","description":"Information exposure through a stack trace","name":"js/stack-trace-exposure","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-209","external/cwe/cwe-497","security"],"full_description":"Propagating stack trace information to an external user can unintentionally reveal implementation details that are useful to an attacker for developing a subsequent exploit.","help":"# Information exposure through a stack trace\nSoftware developers often add stack traces to error messages, as a debugging aid.

As such, the user is able to see a detailed stack trace, which may contain sensitive information.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function onRequest(req, res) {\n  var body;\n  try {\n    body = handleRequest(req);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    res.statusCode = 500;\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n    res.end(err.stack); // NOT OK\n    return;\n  }\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Length\", body.length);\n  res.end(body);\n}).listen(3000);\n\n```\nInstead, the stack trace should be logged only on the server. That way, the developers can still access and use the error log, but remote users will not see the information:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function onRequest(req, res) {\n  var body;\n  try {\n    body = handleRequest(req);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    res.statusCode = 500;\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n    log(\"Exception occurred\", err.stack);\n    res.end(\"An exception occurred\"); // OK\n    return;\n  }\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Length\", body.length);\n  res.end(body);\n}).listen(3000);\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Improper Error Handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-209](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-497](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/497.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.20.5"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:javascript-typescript\",\"language\":\"javascript-typescript\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-22.04\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"23648bbf5ecdd4f14fb1e70223ff618368597b05","message":{"text":"This information exposed to the user depends on stack trace information."},"location":{"path":"nuxt/server-middleware/trames.js","start_line":140,"end_line":140,"start_column":26,"end_column":29},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/40/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":39,"created_at":"2025-02-02T11:32:22Z","updated_at":"2025-02-02T11:34:19Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/Docurba/code-scanning/alerts/39","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/Docurba/security/code-scanning/39","assignees":[],"state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/stack-trace-exposure","severity":"warning","description":"Information exposure through a stack trace","name":"js/stack-trace-exposure","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-209","external/cwe/cwe-497","security"],"full_description":"Propagating stack trace information to an external user can unintentionally reveal implementation details that are useful to an attacker for developing a subsequent exploit.","help":"# Information exposure through a stack trace\nSoftware developers often add stack traces to error messages, as a debugging aid.

In these attacks, unsuspecting users can be redirected to a malicious site that looks very similar to the real site they intend to visit, but which is controlled by the attacker.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against untrusted URL redirection, it is advisable to avoid putting user input directly into a redirect URL. Instead, maintain a list of authorized redirects on the server; then choose from that list based on the user input provided.\n\nIf this is not possible, then the user input should be validated in some other way, for example, by verifying that the target URL does not include an explicit host name.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in a URL redirect without validating the input, which facilitates phishing attacks:\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    return redirect(target, code=302)\n\n```\nIf you know the set of valid redirect targets, you can maintain a list of them on the server and check that the user input is in that list:\n\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\n\nVALID_REDIRECT = \"http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html\"\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    if target == VALID_REDIRECT:\n        return redirect(target, code=302)\n    else:\n        # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n        return redirect('/', code=302)\n\n```\nOften this is not possible, so an alternative is to check that the target URL does not specify an explicit host name. For example, you can use the `urlparse` function from the Python standard library to parse the URL and check that the `netloc` attribute is empty.\n\nNote, however, that some cases are not handled as we desire out-of-the-box by `urlparse`, so we need to adjust two things, as shown in the example below:\n\n* Many browsers accept backslash characters (`\\`) as equivalent to forward slash characters (`/`) in URLs, but the `urlparse` function does not.\n* Mistyped URLs such as `https:/example.com` or `https:///example.com` are parsed as having an empty `netloc` attribute, while browsers will still redirect to the correct site.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    target = request.args.get('target', '')\n    target = target.replace('\\\\', '')\n    if not urlparse(target).netloc and not urlparse(target).scheme:\n        # relative path, safe to redirect\n        return redirect(target, code=302)\n    # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n    return redirect('/', code=302)\n\n```\nFor Django application, you can use the function `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme` to check that a URL is safe to redirect to, as shown in the following example:\n\n\n```python\nfrom django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\nfrom django.shortcuts import redirect\nfrom django.utils.http import url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme\nfrom django.views import View\n\nclass RedirectView(View):\n    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n        target = request.GET.get('target', '')\n        if url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme(target, allowed_hosts=None):\n            return HttpResponseRedirect(target)\n        else:\n            # ignore the target and redirect to the home page\n            return redirect('/')\n```\nNote that `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme` handles backslashes correctly, so no additional processing is required.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [ XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Python standard library: [ urllib.parse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html).\n","security_severity_level":"medium"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.23.2"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:analyze","environment":"{\"build-mode\":\"none\",\"category\":\"/language:python\",\"language\":\"python\",\"runner\":\"[\\\"ubuntu-latest\\\"]\"}","category":"/language:python","state":"open","commit_sha":"6c6f08e9d858dfbd5f18cbf72a8ccf4218eee45e","message":{"text":"Untrusted URL redirection depends on a user-provided value."},"location":{"path":"envergo/petitions/views.py","start_line":1284,"end_line":1284,"start_column":21,"end_column":29},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/21/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null},{"number":17,"created_at":"2025-04-23T09:56:50Z","updated_at":"2025-04-23T09:56:50Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MTES-MCT/envergo/code-scanning/alerts/17","html_url":"https://github.com/MTES-MCT/envergo/security/code-scanning/17","assignees":[],"state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"actions/missing-workflow-permissions","severity":"warning","description":"Workflow does not contain permissions","name":"actions/missing-workflow-permissions","tags":["actions","external/cwe/cwe-275","maintainability","security"],"full_description":"Workflows should contain explicit permissions to restrict the scope of the default GITHUB_TOKEN.","help":"## Overview\n\nIf a GitHub Actions job or workflow has no explicit permissions set, then the repository permissions are used.

An attacker can leverage this to manipulate\nthe chain of events being recorded.</p>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nimport logging\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/example')\ndef log():\n    data = request.args[\"data\"]\n    app.logger.critical(\"%s\", data) # Noncompliant\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nimport logging\nimport base64\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/example')\ndef log():\n    data = request.args[\"data\"]\n    if data.isalnum():\n        app.logger.critical(\"%s\", data)\n    else:\n        app.logger.critical(\"Invalid Input: %s\", base64.b64encode(data.encode('UTF-8')))\n</pre>\n<h3>How does this work?</h3>\n<p>Data used for logging should be content-restricted and typed. This can be done by validating the data content or sanitizing it.<br> Validation and\nsanitization mainly revolve around preventing carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) characters. However, further actions could be required based on\nthe application context and the logged data usage.</p>\n<p>Here, the example compliant code uses the <code>isalnum</code> function to ensure the untrusted data is safe. If not, it performs Base64 encoding\nto protect from log injection.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<h3>Standards</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/\">OWASP Top 10 2021

cross-site scripting vulnerability.","help":"# DOM text reinterpreted as HTML\nExtracting text from a DOM node and interpreting it as HTML can lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.\n\nA webpage with this vulnerability reads text from the DOM, and afterwards adds the text as HTML to the DOM. Using text from the DOM as HTML effectively unescapes the text, and thereby invalidates any escaping done on the text. If an attacker is able to control the safe sanitized text, then this vulnerability can be exploited to perform a cross-site scripting attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing text to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the References section below.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a webpage using a `data-target` attribute to select and manipulate a DOM element using the JQuery library. In the example, the `data-target` attribute is read into the `target` variable, and the `$` function is then supposed to use the `target` variable as a CSS selector to determine which element should be manipulated.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n    $(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\nHowever, if an attacker can control the `data-target` attribute, then the value of `target` can be used to cause the `$` function to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThe above vulnerability can be fixed by using `$.find` instead of `$`.
