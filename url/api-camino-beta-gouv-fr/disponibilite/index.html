injection","name":"js/log-injection","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-117","security"],"full_description":"Building log entries from user-controlled sources is vulnerable to insertion of forged log entries by a malicious user.","help":"# Log injection\nIf unsanitized user input is written to a log entry, a malicious user may be able to forge new log entries.\n\nForgery can occur if a user provides some input with characters that are interpreted when the log output is displayed. If the log is displayed as a plain text file, then new line characters can be used by a malicious user. If the log is displayed as HTML, then arbitrary HTML may be included to spoof log entries.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUser input should be suitably sanitized before it is logged.\n\nIf the log entries are in plain text then line breaks should be removed from user input, using `String.prototype.replace` or similar. Care should also be taken that user input is clearly marked in log entries.\n\nFor log entries that will be displayed in HTML, user input should be HTML-encoded before being logged, to prevent forgery and other forms of HTML injection.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the first example, a username, provided by the user, is logged using \\`console.info\\`. In the first case, it is logged without any sanitization. In the second case, the username is used to build an error that is logged using \\`console.error\\`.
